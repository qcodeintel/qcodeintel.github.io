This justified the supposed  \"patience\" approach instead of more effective actions in deterring NK, or more assertive world action in discovering what was really going on with whomever was helping NK in their nuclear progress.  This would fit into an overall nefarious plan to \"suddenly\" discover how big a threat NK is and push the world into another war.\nhttp://www.academia.edu/2978256/North_Koreas_Nuclear_Weapons_Program_to_2015_Three_Scenarios\n\n********\nBig events (could this have been tests of miniature nuke?) in December 26th 2004 with 9.1 earth quake in India Ocean and triggers the largest Tsunamis Killing 200k people.

So what Kim and the Globalists are going to do instead is launch multiple 'failed' nukes into the ocean that doesn't explode.\n\nThen, later, a 'missing' sub (stolen) goes pick it up.  The sub goes goes to Russian water, then launch a nuke at America.  America will think Russia have just launch a nuke at America, so America will nuke Russia back.  America and Russia destroys each other.  Globalists laugh all the way to the bank.\n\nThe missing sub...\n\nThe Hunt For Red October...\nThe Sum Of All Fear...\n\nAnswer - SPECULATION \n\nNK was controlled ever since WW2. CIA co-opted NK, they work for the CIA, and the CIA is controlled by Shadow government that is being run by the Globalists.\n\nWhat they are trying to do with North Korea, they already did during WW2 with the Nazi.\n\nThey were able to get the world to enter into World War I by assassinating one country's prince and blaming it on another country.\n\nThey want to use North Korea to nuke America.  If North Korea nuke America, America will nuke back.  With North Korea and America gone, and with Europe fully under control, the Globalist will have won.\n\n1) Bad guys power greater than many had thought with control of nuke arsenal. Source of Arsenal is traitors within US government.\n\n2) Act of 1871 - the USA is a corporation. We are living and have been living under a second Constitution and Martial Law for a very long time.

The thought occurred to me to not have all your eggs in the NK basket even if you directly control it. Having a non-compliant scapegoat to achieve other policy goals is a bonus/fallback. UPDATE: It's the Nizari Ismail and their leader Aga Khan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aga_Khan_IV\n\n### Purpose was to open a situation in which the Uranium One deal could occur.\n\nSPECULATION: Clinton was trolling putin, hey look we control NK and they have nukes on your doorstep.\n\nSPECULATION 2: \"Russian reset\" was an ongoing thaw attempt to influence and corrupt Russia e.g. Mikhail Khodorkhovsky, Pussy Riot\n\nAnswer 3 - \"Russian Reset\" was to make it look like they were working with the Russians again.

Korea\n\n_________________________________________\nfrom http://powerbase.info/index.php/Asia_Foundation\nThe Asia Foundation based in San Francisco and founded in 1954, was established and subsidized by the CIA until 1967 when the link was exposed. Since 1984, through the Asia Foundation Act, its funding source has changed to the State Department. Today it has 18 offices across Asia, 12 of which were established by 'anti-communist propagandist', James L. Stewart [1]\n\n    It \"was founded in 1954 and throughout the 1960s had an annual budget of about $8 million. This money was used to support Asian schools and libraries, give travel grants to Asians for international conferences, and in support of expanded Pacific trade. In 1967 it was revealed that they were receiving CIA funds. Victor Marchetti, once an executive assistant to the CIA's deputy director, is less delicate -- he says Asia Foundation was established by the CIA and until 1967 was heavily subsidized by them, even though some of their activities were legitimate. \n\n\"In 1987 the Foundation received $10 million from State and another $3.7 million from AID, in addition to private support (88 percent of which was in the form of donated books) and matching Asian contributions.\" [2]\n\nIn Afghanistan, the organization works in conjunction with the mercenary firm, Global Risk Strategies.\n\n______________________________________\nfrom https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp75-00149r000600430021-9\nCIA and Asia Foundation are linked\n\nAsia Foundation Findings:\nQ drop - https://8ch.net/cbts/res/13366.html#13601\nThe Asia Foundation.\nCIA-RDP84B00049R001303260026-4\nHappy hunting.\nQ\nDoc Q references pertains to a doc of Asia Foundation Trustees requesting continuted gov. funding for TAF.

Hannah Bouveng, the employee who had been the subject of the alleged harassment, had filed an $850 million lawsuit against Wey's company earlier that month. Law360 quoted Wey as saying that the lawsuits were \"frivolous\" and \"an extortion attempt.\"[30] The sexual harassment trial opened on June 15, 2015, at the Manhattan Federal District Court. It closed on June 29, 2015, with the jury awarding Bouveng $18 million—$2 million in compensatory damages and $16 million in punitive damages, primarily for defamation by Wey, NYGG, and its subsidiary FNL Media who publish TheBlot. While the allegations of assault and battery were rejected, the jurors found in Bouveng's favor on the charges of sexual harassment, retaliation and defamation.[35][36] In April 2016, the award was reduced to $5.6 million by a Federal District Court judge.[37]\"\n\n\"In September 2015, Wey was indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury on eight counts of conspiracy, securities and wire fraud, and money laundering in connection with his reverse merger scheme and involving the companies SmartHeat, Deer Consumer Products, and CleanTech Innovations. Wey was accused of using the offshore accounts to cloak transactions between Chinese operating companies and American shell companies.[40][41] In addition to the criminal charges, the SEC filed a parallel civil lawsuit against Wey which also included as defendants Wey's wife, his sister, and two of his attorneys, all of whom were alleged by SEC complaint to have committed \"violations or the aiding and abetting of violations of the antifraud provisions and the disclosure and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws\".\n\nIn September 2017, the SEC dropped its fraud charges against Wey and his wife.\n\n\nPriscilla Chan-pediatrician\n\n2P\n\n(RED)?\n\n6 D's vs 18 R's?\n\nThey were told not to seek re-election or their crimes would be prosecuted.\n\nTax reform\n\nEnough R's voted for it, even McCain\neven McCain.\n\nAnswer #2: If what the Shadow Brokers have on John M and and Senator Graham is true, and there are no coincidences, for the sake of his family's name I'd vote for the tax bill instead of nasty very public fallout and the subsequent falling dominos.\n\nmilitary\n\nYes, or be exposed for vile monstrosity of the highest orders\n\nMeet new management, not the same as old management\n\nYou have me enthralled and out of the shadows\n\nBMT?

It's a time when society leaves 40 years of mind numbing group think to enter into a period of individual thought and colaboration. This is a time when Liberty and Freedom are rediscovered and scientific discoveries occur at a faster pace. Also, it's preceeded by catastrophic war. In 1776 the Declaration of Independance was sent to King George. In 1780, the American Revolution. In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected president, the Civil War followed. In the 1930's Hitler came into power, in the 1941 WW2. War preceeds the Great awakening. All 80 years apart. All caused by an oppressor of some kind. King George monarchy, Southern Democrat slave owners, and Marxist based Hegemony. This is also the subject of the book The Fourth Turning by William Strauss.\n\n"

The center will be hosted by the University of Chicago and will be located in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois. The center will not be part of the presidential library network operated by National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).[3] The nonprofit Barack Obama Foundation was established to oversee the creation of the Center and the construction of its campus.\"\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration—which operates presidential library-museums for every president from Herbert Hoover through George W. Bush—won’t be operating either for Obama. His private Obama Foundation, not the government, will own and operate the museum. And there really won’t be a presidential library. The Obama Foundation will pay for NARA to digitize unclassified records and release them to the public as they become available, but the center’s “Library,” which may or may not house a local branch of the Chicago Public Library, will not contain or control presidential papers and artifacts, digital or otherwise. Instead, according to a NARA press release that called the museum “a new model for the preservation and accessibility of presidential records,” those records will be stored in “existing NARA facilities”—meaning one or more of the agency’s research or records centers across the country.\n\n### The Attorney General and the Counsel to the President, in the exercise of their discretion and after appropriate review and consultation under subsection (a) of this section, may jointly determine that invocation of executive privilege is not justified.

Imran Awan links may go as far back as Anthony Weiner, when Weiner was in Congress. It appears Awan began with Weiner, Weiner lost his seat, so Debbie was passed the torch. Imran provided doped/hacked phones to members of Congress(among other things too). It is likely the Awan Group is referenced in an email from Hillary to Huma that says \"Maybe one of Anothony's trusted staff could deliver secure phone?\"\n\n### Where do they have offices?\n\nWashington DC, Bahrain, Malaysia, Pakistan, KSA, China, USA, UAE, Singapore, and Cyprus.

Follow Huma.\n\nHuma has attended several public events and been seen with her family in NYC.\n\n### This has nothing to do w/ Russia (yet).\n\nThis may have something to do with Russia as events progress, due to NK and Iran.\n\n### Why does Potus surround himself w/ generals?\n\n- To prevent a coup and ensure the safety of executive.\n- The Generals he picked are loyal to the country and well respected in the military.\n- They are experts in strategy.\n\n### What is military intelligence?\n\nA military discipline that uses information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to commanders in support of their decisions.\n\n### Why go around the 3 letter agencies?\n\nBecause the 3-letters agencies have been infiltrated by bad actors who are not acting in the interest of the US\n\n### Who has ultimate authority over our branches of military w\\o approval conditions unless 90+ in wartime conditions?\n\nPOTUS\n\n### What is the military code?\n\nMilitary code is a system of conventional symbols for the covert transmission of secret military information through communications equipment.\n\nThe conventional symbols are made up by the staff headquarters and may be numbers, letters, and so forth. The simplest military codes are conversation and radio-signal tables made up for a definite span of time or the duration of a combat operation. There are combined-arms and special military codes (for one combat arm or one service of the armed forces, such as an aviation or navy code)\n\n### Where is AW being held? Why?\n\n(Anthony Weiner, husband of Huma Abedin)\nAnthony Wiener is in the Federal jail.\n\n### POTUS will not go on tv to address nation.\n\nPOTUS will not discuss ongoing investigations into the Swamp.\n\n### POTUS must isolate himself to prevent negative optics.\n\nIf POTUS did so, it would invite criticism and a media storm upon which there would be focus, capitalized on and distorted, which would be inappropriate and damaging to the POTUS and the office.\n\n### POTUS knew removing criminal rogue elements as a first step was essential to free and pass legislation.\n\nPOTUS is going to let Lady Justice prove nobody is above the law. POTUS exercised his authority granted to him through irresponsible allocations of power to the Executive Office. Everything POTUS is doing is legal because the swamp made it legal for it's own nefarious purposes.\n\n### Who has access to everything classified?\n\nJeff Sessions (Attorney General) is the only person who knows everything. Literally everything.\n\nHe knows where the bodies are buried.\nHe knows the bank information.\nHe knows everything.\nHe probably knows things the President doesn't know for the sake of OPSec.\nA President interested in the pursuit of justice instead of obstructing it to cover their masters asses means actual tangible enforcement of Justice.\n\n### Do you believe HRC, Soros, Obama etc have more power than Trump? Fantasy.\n\nNo.\n\n### Whoever controls the office of the Presidecy controls this great land.\n\nThe people control this great land, the President represents the people to the world, and monitors, protects, and defends the people that control this land.\n\n### They never believed for a moment they (Democrats and Republicans) would lose control.\n\nThey never thought they would lose the Executive Office, and when they did it was an immediate declaration of war between the Patriotic Factions of the US Government and the Swamp..\n\n### This is not a R v D battle.\n\nThe partisan bickering you see publicly is a dog and pony show and dramatics for public consumption.\n\n### Why did Soros donate all his money recently?\n\nExtra slush funds were needed to accomplish the agenda. His Open Society Foundation disseminates the slush fund to other parties for operations.\n\n### Why would he place all his funds in a RC?\n\nLess investigations happen into (registered) charities because all monies are donated and go towards “good causes” so long as the charity isn’t being used to make a profit. Open Society Foundation offers grants to individuals and organisations, however the majority are organisations. You don’t have to apply for a grant like most charities, OSF will actually approach you if they deem your organisation suitable for “investment”\n\n### Mockingbird\n\nOperation Mockingbird- the CIA placed a bunch of assets into media organizations to control the narrative. This was done AFTER it was made illegal for the government to subject the American people to propaganda, but they got away with it anyway.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nPOTUS will not go on TV to address nation. POTUS must isolate himself to prevent negative optics. POTUS knew that removing criminal rogue elements was a first step and essential to freedom to pass legislation. Someone has access to everything classified. Hillary, Soros, Obama etc don't have more power than Trump. Whoever controls the office of the Presidecy controls this great land. Democrats and Republicans never believed for a moment they would lose control. This is not a RvD battle. Soros donated all his money recently. He placed all his funds in a RC.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### Mockingbird\n\n### HRC detained, not arrested (yet).\n\nMilitary or strategic deception is sometimes necessary.

Strict rules for engagement.\n\n### Why go around the 3 letter agencies?\n\n3 letter agencies have civilian staff. More secrecy and politically motivated missions.

This was done in order to launder their unbacked currency in the War Machine. The merging of the two parties has two dramatics: the dramatic of the latent, the truth we cannot see expressed as the dramatic of the manifest, the \"expressing\" of bipartisan mutual contention with the other\n\n### Why did Soros donate all his money recently?\n\nAfter the SA purge the slush fund operation was severely hindered. A cash injection was probably required to maintain the bribes in place/give another foundation that could be used to legitimise payments.

Hillary may or may not have been detained (but not arrested yet). Sometimes strategic or military deception is necessary. Huma Abedin attended an event in NYC on Oct. 25, walked with her family in NYC on Oct 27, attended HRC's 70th birthday part and seen with her son on Nov. 6 and 7th. This may have something to do with Russia as events progress, due to North Korea and Iran. POTUS surrounds himself with generals to ensure the safety of the executive and prevent any attempts at a coup because the generals he picked are loyal and experts at strategy. Marines in particular are deployable at POTUS' discretion without Congressional approval. Military Intelligence (MI) is a discipline that uses information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to commanders in support of their decisions. The reason to do around the 3-letter agencies (CIA, FBI et al) is that they have been infiltrated by bad actors who aren't acting in the best interests of the US. Those agencies also have civilian staff, more secrecy and politically-motivated missions, which lead to too much leaking and input from politicians. POTUS has the ultimate authority over our branches of military without approval conditions unless over 90 days in wartime conditions, due to the War Powers Act. The military code is a system of conventional symbols for the covert transmission of secret military information through communications equipment. Anthony Weiner, husband of Huma Abedin is in Federal Medical Center, Devens, a federal prison in Massachusetts., minimum security for male sex offenders. POTUS will go on tv to address the nation to discuss ongoing investigations into corruption and other crimes in Washington D.C.. Doing so would invite criticism and a media storm upon which there would be focus, capitalized on and distorted, which would be inappropriate and damaging to the POTUS and the office. POTUS knew the first step was to remove rogue criminal elements let Lady Justice prove nobody is above the law. POTUS exercised his authority granted to him through irresponsible allocations of power to the Executive Office. Everything POTUS is doing is legal because the swamp made it legal for it's own nefarious purposes. Besides the NSA, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the only person who knows everything.  If Sessions is the prosecutor then he knows everything because he's the one building the case. He has access to  evidence collected by parties like Admiral Rogers and General Kelly and probably more. General Kelly probably isn't aware of the intelligence Admiral Rogers has dropped on Sessions in it's entirety, just as Admiral Rogers isn't privy to all the information General Kelly has offered. For a case like this, everything is compartmentalized. Even the President probably only knows exactly what he needs to know to run his office effectively. The man at the top would be the only person who knew the entire lay of the land, that man is Jeff Sessions. It is a fantasy to believe that HRC, Soros, Obama et al have more power than POTUS. Whoever controls the office of the Presidecy controls this great land. They never thought they would lose the Executive Office, and when they did it was an immediate declaration of war between the Patriotic Factions of the US Government and the Swamp. This is not a Republican versus Democrat battle. The partisan bickering you see publicly is a dog and pony show and dramatics for public consumption. George Soros donated $18 billion to the Open Society because extra slush funds were needed to accomplish the agenda. His Open Society Foundation disseminates the slush fund to other parties for operations. Less investigations happen into (registered) charities because all monies are donated and go towards “good causes” so long as the charity isn’t being used to make a profit. Open Society Foundation offers grants to individuals and organisations,\n\n"

This was a hostile takeover from an evil corrupt network of players (not just Democrats).\n\nPatriots in the government and POTUS are working hard to purge the bad actors, who are not the majority and not limited to one political party.\n\n### Don’t fool yourself into thinking Obama, Soros, Roth’s, Clinton’s etc have more power present day than POTUS.\n\nThe individuals/families named only have tenuous power, based either on family wealth (see fund flow disruption below) or protection/support of those with wealth. If either are cut off from accessing that wealth, their power disappears. POTUS, on the other hand has the power of the US government and Military that he wields, for the good of America not personal gain or power-grabbing.\n\n### Follow the money, it’s the key.\n\nThe trail of funds from the named persons/families, through intermediaries including foundations, NGOs, contracts, investments based on inside trading provides the key to who owns whom and can help generate a map of corruption within the network of bad actors.\n\n### What is Pelosi’s net worth by way of one example. Why coincidentally is her memory apparently going?\n\n$140mm https://networthpost.com/nancy-pelosi-net-worth/\nTo build a story around \"mental deterioration\"\n\n### Cover for possible future indictment to plead what?\n\nIn order to be able to be insulated from prosecution, can claim mental incompetent to stand trial due to dementia\n\n### What if John M never had surgery and that was a cover for a future out if needed against prosecution?\n\nSignals not only that he is afraid of prosecution, but is an admission of guilt by trying to build a cover for a future plea of mental incompetence.\n\n### Why did Soros transfer his bulk public funds to a NP? Note this doesn’t include massive slush funds that are pulled by several high ups.\n\nTo better protect the money: to keep it off his own personal \"books\" for \n1) protection from prosecution \n2) to launder it into other offshore accounts.\n\n### Why did Soros’ son have several meetings with Canadian PM and how is that related to Clinton’s?\n\n### Why is MS13 a priority?\n\nBesides being a conduit for drugs and weapons, MS-13 functions as a shadow, proxy-army for the deep state and bad actors, committing assassinations of opponents political and otherwise. They also function as sleeper cells to be activated at a later date to unleash chaos, disorder and mayhem on the public. This must be stopped and cleaned out immediately.\n\n### Could people pay such gangs to kill opponents and why / how to insulate against exposure?\n\nUsing gangs as assassins has historical precedent and provides the person ordering the initial \"hit\" layers of plausible deniability by going through several intermediaries in the underworld (separate social spheres). No one would expect, hypothetically, for Nancy Pelosi to ask an MS-13 member to kill someone.\n\n### The truth is mind blowing and cannot fully be exposed. These people are evil.\n\nThe extent of corruption is pervasive but still within the reach of the common person to grasp. But the level of degeneracy and occult acts, and the widespread nature of that, is so shocking and foreign that most people will not be able to accept the truth that many members of our government engage in this activity. It is simply too shocking and horrifying, and yet it is true.\n\n### Operation Mockingbird\n\nMockingbird media is how the public is not aware of the answers to the questions Q just posed. The connections are purposely avoided in the Mockingbird media to cover for the cabal and the network of bad actors' deeds.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n## extra answers\n\n### Some of us come here to drop crumbs, just crumbs.\n\n### POTUS is 100% insulated - any discussion suggesting he’s even a target is false.\n\n-He has his own network instead of the government provided network. That's why he wanted his own plane refitted instead of using AF1\n\n### Follow Huma tomorrow.\n\n### POTUS will not be addressing nation on any of these issues as people begin to be indicted and must remain neutral for pure optical reasons. To suggest this is the plan is false and should be common sense.\n\nAny notifications of arrests of politicos would be done by the Justice Department. Remember how the US government works and the purview of different agencies and departments.\n\n### Focus on Military Intelligence/ State Secrets and why might that be used vs any three letter agency\n\nThis is due to several reasons: \n1) the likelihood the act shall result in loss-of-life and/or harm to US servicemembers and/or US Gov property (installations, ships, aircraft), \n2) the act could compromise Def Dept regs mandating the conducting of no more than six operational theaters of war at any given time, \n3) the information's source indicates a clear violation of security clearance protocols, and thus violates National Security.\n\nIn case 3, Homeland Sec Act, and Patriot Act, and Military Commissions Act(s) mandate the violator(s) loss of Constitutional Rights, and confirms the violator as an enemy agent provacateur, now subject to the UCMJ. (Uniformed Code of Military Justice)\n\n### What SC decision opened the door for a sitting President to activate - what must be showed?\n\nAlthough the ruling was a defeat for the government in the specific case, it seemed to confirm presidential powers to form military tribunals\nhttp://www.4lawschool.com/case-briefs/hamdan-v-rumsfeld\n\n### Why is POTUS surrounded by generals?\n\n### Again, there are a lot more good people than bad so have faith.

Why coincidentally is her memory apparently going?\n\n\"I can't remember' will be her answer to all questions.\n\n### Cover for possible future indictment to plead what?\n\nnon compos mentis (not mentally capable)\n\n### What if John M never had surgery and that was a cover for a future out if needed against prosecution?\n\nIt is highly unlikely that JM had a positive diagnosis for a primary glioblastoma as report by CNN. Primary glioblastoma is most often found in the back of the brain and treatment consists of  surgery with aggressive battery of radiation and chemotherapy. Survivial rates are low, only 39% of adults live one year post diagnosis.\n\nCNN: http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/health/gupta-mccain-glioblastoma/index.html\n\nWebMD: https://www.webmd.com/cancer/brain-cancer/what-is-glioblastoma#1\n\n### Why did Soros transfer his bulk public funds to a NP? Note this doesn’t include massive slush funds that are pulled by several high ups.\n\nTo continue plans that those organizations have to been tasked to do.e.g. Antifa  Fund diversions. Because Open Society has operatives in nearly every country, this allows him to still have power with money globally.\n\n### Why did Soros’ son have several meetings with Canadian PM and how is that related to Clinton’s?\n\n- Because Clinton's received money for Uranium One through the foundation in Canada, could this be an attempt to receive assistance in covering evidence?\n- Fusion GPS is located in Canada. Possibly to threaten the implications of Canada conspiring with them to/pay off to keep quiet.\n\n### Why is MS13 a priority?\n\nMs-13 acting as assassins, and secret army follows CIA and FBI history for contracting dirty work. Their handbook says, \"never do your own killing.\"\n\n### Could people pay such gangs to kill opponents and why / how to insulate against exposure?\n\n### The truth is mind blowing and cannot fully be exposed. These people are evil.\n\nSomething that must be considered is civil unrest. A distraught populace could react in violent and unpredictable ways.  People could fall into despair or become dangerous with a mob mentality and do something that would not heal our country but divide it further.\n\n### Operation Mockingbird\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

Democrats have historically committed voter fraud with this population group by bussing people around to vote multiple times at different polling locations, having felons vote (illegal except in VA), dead persons voting in order to swing elections in their favor. Without this voting bloc, Democrats would lose seats in local, state and federal elections.\n\n### At some point the great awakening will occur whereby these false local / national black leaders are corrupt and paid off to help keep the black pop poor and in need.\n\nUnless something really radical, hard evidence comes out, Blacks will be in denial. So conditioned by identity politics, they will say such actions are racist.\n\n### D’s formed the confederate states against freeing slaves.\n\nIncorrect.

It will also disgust many others who have voted D their entire lives.The new revelations will be extremely disconcerting to our younger generation and a lesson in trust.\n\n### Through the looking glass.\n\nPeople are seeing a mirror-world where things are backwards, and what they believe is real is not. It is easier to keep control of the population (especially the black population for Democrats) this way.\n\n### They rely on the MSM to keep the narrative going but tech is entrenching on their controls.

As long as the Black population believes this, the Democrats maintain control of this important voting bloc though they make up only 12% of the population.\n\n### At some point the great awakening will occur whereby these false local / national black leaders are corrupt and paid off to help keep the black pop poor and in need.\n\n### D’s formed the confederate states against freeing slaves.\n\nFederal government wanted slaves to be counted as property to be taxed to fill the coffers. It should also be noted that Pres. Lincoln freed ONLY the slaves in the South, not the North. The was was never about slavery.\n\n### D’s formed the KKK.\n\nThe best way to shift the Overton Window is through a serious, fear based event where the \"victim\" is so terrorized that they will gladly sacrifice their liberty for promised safety. The perpetrator moves forward by constantly reminding the victim that it is them who \"saved\" them from the evil.\n\n### HRC’s mentor is who?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd\nSaul Alinsky\nhttp://www.washingtonexaminer.com/want-to-understand-hillary-clinton-read-saul-alinsky/article/2602071\n\n### What happens if the truth about Haiti is released?

No current approval or congressional oversight as State Secrets are upheld under Supreme Court. The POTUS can impose Military Intel take over investigations for the 3 letter agencies, but conditions must present itself. This is so VERY important.\n\nSomeone surrounds POTUS. They lost this very important power - the one area of the government not corrupt and directly serving POTUS.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### Key:\n\n### Military Intelligence v FBI CIA NSA\n\n1. MI is not as corrupted and infested with globalist assets \n2. MI is under the direction of POTUS ONLY, not other agencies. \n3. MI OPS (operations) and products are protected from other corrupt agencies using STATE SECRETS powers, which the globalists gave to POTUS over the last 30 years. Now its turned on them.\n\n### No approval or congressional oversight\n\n### State Secrets upheld under SC\n\nAn evidentiary rule created by U.S. legal precedent. Application of the privilege results in exclusion of evidence from a legal case based solely on affidavits submitted by the government stating that court proceedings might disclose sensitive information which might endanger national security. U.S. v. Reynolds, which involved military secrets, was the first case that saw formal recognition of the privilege. Following a claim of \"state secrets privilege\", the court rarely conducts an in camera examination of the evidence to evaluate whether there is sufficient cause to support the use of this doctrine. This results in court rulings in which even the judge has not verified the veracity of the assertion. The privileged material is completely removed from the litigation, and the court must determine how the unavailability of the privileged information affects the case.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege\n\n### Who is the Commander and Chief of the military?\n\n### Under what article can the President impose MI take over investigations for the 3 letter agencies? What conditions must present itself? Why is this so VERY important? Who surrounds POTUS? They lost this very important power _ the one area of the govt not corrupt and directly serves POTUS.\n\nUnder provisions of both the Homeland Security Act, Military Commissions Act(s), and The PATRIOT Act, the POTUS, either via his sec, or by sending armed troops to halt the attempts to resist launched by pseudo state operative Elaine Duke, current Secretary of Homeland Security, may engage in any number of activities to halt treason by forces hostile to the United States within the Armed Forces, or cease an entire Dept of US Gov from its compromised authority. These were checks and balances to the usurption and abuse of US internal policy which, as in the case of some Sept 11 Attackers whose visas were not thoroughly vetted, where these bureacratic practices could amount to \"holes\" in the US statuatory armor. Also, the Pat Act gives Potus the authority to declare any group hostile to US \"terrorists\". \n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.crf-usa.org/america-responds-to-terrorism/the-patriot-act.html&ved=0ahUKEwi5lZrC57vXAhUm6oMKHQ_9DtUQFggsMAE&usg=AOvVaw3ZZbNiz5OhLr-k9nNy8Yt3 \n\nAt that point, under PATRIOT Act detention is legal, and under the Military Commissions Act of 2008, the tribunals are now engageable.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nMI does not answer to Congress, has the most access to mined data and classified information. They have the best information gathering tools, They also have more power in general and are devoted to the constitution. MI can take over the investigations for the other three in cases of high treason. The State Secrets Act was upheld in the Supreme Court United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953) acknowledging the right of the government to exclude evidence in a trial that may harm National Security. The President is the Commander in Chief of the Military and the Chief of Staff is Gen. John Kelly, a Marine. The President can use military (& National Guard) as police force in the event of terrorist act, natural disasters and disorder that state police cannot contain.\n\n"

It can be a secure room or data center that guards against electronic surveillance and suppresses data leakage of sensitive security and military information.\n\n### Military Intelligence\n\nA military discipline that uses information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to commanders in support of their decisions\n\n### What is 'State Secrets' and how upheld in the SC?\n\nState secret privilege (SSP) makes it so the president can refuse to present evidence if it's secret information that would harm national security or foreign relation interests. After 9/11 Bush expanded SSP so that evidence could be withheld and cases dismissed in U.S. courts.\n\n### What must be completed to engage MI over other (3) letter agencies?\n\nDOD must have clear and verified reason to believe the Republic is at Risk and must execute their duty to protect the POTUS and Constitution. An executive order is invoked which enables POTUS to mobilize DNI to create a war council of sorts\n\n### What must occur to allow for civilian trials?\n\nMilitary law can be applied to civilians, but only in special circumstances. If a nation declares \"martial law,\" military authority replaces civilian authority. Under martial law, the military operates the police, courts, and legislature instead of the civilian government.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nIf Trump declares martial law (i.e., under the pretext of Antifa problems), it will be to circumvent the corrupt judicial system.\n\n### What was Flynn's background?\n\nAccording to Wiki: Michael Thomas Flynn (born December 1958) is a retired United States Army Lieutenant General, who served in the Army for 33 years until 2014. Flynn's military career included a key role in shaping U.S. counterterrorism strategy and dismantling insurgent networks in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he was given numerous combat arms, conventional, and special operationssenior intelligence assignments. He was appointed by President Barack Obama as the eighteenth director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, serving from July 2012 to his retirement from the military in August 2014. After leaving the military, he established Flynn Intel Group which has provided intelligence services for businesses and governments, including ones in Turkey.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nIt shows Flynn is a patriot/not compromised.\n\n### Why did Adm R (NSA) meet Trump privately w/o auth?\n\nAdm. Rogers didn't want to participate in Obama admin's spying scheme and wanted to alert Trump to illegal wiretapping of his campaign, make his loyalty to America and the Constitution known.\n\n### Does POTUS know where the bodies are buried?\n\nOf course he does\n- During one of the Debates with Clinton she started to make accusations, Trump said, ' Be careful I know things, I know alot of things.'\n- He made multiple references to HRC’s 1980 to 2012 adventures in the election debates that made JEB & HRC flinch.\n\n### Does POTUS have the goods on most bad actors?\n\nYes, Trump has turned the NSA's collection system that has been used by the Deep State (as the world learned from Edward Snowden) against them.  The extent of the possible data collection and tools for doing it were revealed by Wikileaks Vault 7. A lot of collected emails and phone calls are being reviewed and utilized on behalf of the US republic.\n\n### Was TRUMP asked to run for President?\n\nYes\n\n### Why?\n\nHRC was known by Saudi intelligence and French intelligence to be too weak of a actor to win on her own. Like stacking the deck of the nomination by buying out the field and installing DWS as DNC chair, WJC wanted to ensure HRC won, by rigging the RNC.\n\n### By Who?\n\n- [SPECULATION] Bill Clinton as a stalking horse guaranteed to lose to Hillary\nWJC denies this on TV.\n\n- [SPECULATION] break away Patriot groups within Special Forces and IC recruited Trump..\n\n### Was HRC next in line?\n\nAccording to those who thought they controlled the field, yes.\n\n### Was the election suppose to be rigged?\n\nYes. Voting machines were flipping votes; states such as Georgia were reporting computer attacks; dead people were voting; dems were voting multiple times, etc. TPTB wanted Trump to run as a Pied Piper, thinking he could be propped up in the primary and tanked in the general\n\n### Did good people prevent the rigging?\n\nMassive efforts were employed to educate the voters to be on the lookout for flipped votes in the electronic voting machine booths; DDOS (direct denial of service) attacks were being monitored and countered; citizens were filming voting violations and calling the police; voting rolls were being scrutinized, etc.\n- Additionally, there may have been other efforts to thwart vote fraud behind the scenes that are not publicly visible.\n\n### Why did POTUS form a panel to investigate?\n\n1) Notice to the cheaters, \n2) Notice to the network of cheaters, \n3) call attention to public, \n4) show the public how the cheaters (who cried about his claim of the 'game being rigged') would publicly and stridently oppose an investigation, \n5) to pressure those in the network of cheaters to talk/turn others in to save their own hides.\n\n### Has POTUS *ever* made a statement that did not become proven as true/fact?\n\nTECHNICALLY yes (he calls these truthful hyperboles in his book) but I would say for important things or promises he's made, no\n\n### What is POTUS in control of?\n\n-Military, \n-DNI, \n-Disaster Recovery Agency / Backup Government Agency, \n-Executive Authority Office,\n\n### What is the one organization left that isn't corrupt?\n\nNational Guard\nThe US Marines.  \n\n-MI or the NSA. \n-Naval Intelligence or the DoD\n\n### Why does the military play such a vital role?\n\nIt's the one organization left that isn't corrupt, and it is powerful and controlled by Trump. Military tribunals. They can bypass the corrupt judges, prosecutors & juries (who can be bought or are zombie leftists)\n\n### Why is POTUS surrounded by highly respected generals?\n\nHaving the military on your side prevents the possibility of a coup and gives power over the other 3 letter organizations.\n\n### Who guards former Presidents?\n\nSecret Service, X US Marine Honor Guard. Also, PMCs\n\n### Why is that relevant?\n\nSecret Service has been compromised and shown to be corrupt / underfunded for past 8 years. SS has been audited 4 times and found to be in failure of Duty Certificates and Code of Conduct with no change in behavior\n\n### Who guards HRC?\n\nState Department Secret Service (SS)\n\n### Why is ANTIFA allowed to operate?\n\nTrump could use them to declare Martial Law\n\n1) evidence of bad actors calling for and organizing insurrection\n2) links to bigger bad actors (ANTIFA is infiltrated)\n3) flushes out bad actors and their networks\n3a) allows to “follow the money”\n4) calls people's attention to the fact that some really do hate USA and want to destroy it\nANTIFASCISTE AKTION is the actual name of the Communist Party in interwar Germany\n4a) constant indoctrination in “education” and those affiliated\n5) keeps it in people's faces so they can't readily forget\n\n### Why hasn't the MB been classified as a terrorist org?\n\n-Because the MB infiltrated Obama's admin, universities, social media.\n-Ted Cruz tried to in 2015 but the bill didn't pass. Michele Bachman tried to in 2012 but it didn't work because she claimed Huma was MB. Huma was defended by Pelosi, Ellison, and McCain.\n\n### What happens if Soros funded operations get violent and engage in domestic terrorism?\n\n-They can classified as domestic terrorist group\n-He can be declared an enemy of the State. \n-Americans involved with Soros can be charged with crimes up to sedition and terrorism.\n-Marital Law would be declared\n\n10 U.S.C. §§ 331-335 (President may use the militia and Armed Forces to suppress insurrection and enforce federal\n\n### What happens if mayors/ police comms/chiefs do not enforce the law?\n\nSend in the National Guard\n\n### What authority does POTUS have specifically over the Marines?\n\nMarine Corps Law 1834 gives President authority over Marines for any duties President sees fit.\n\nAs outlined in 10 U.S.C. § 5063 and as originally introduced under the National Security Act of 1947, three primary areas of responsibility for the Marine Corps are:Seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns;Development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by amphibious landing forces in coordination with the Army and Air Force; and Such other duties as the President or Department of Defense may direct.\n\n### Why is this important?\n\nbecause its the Marine Corps responsibility to to protect the president and Us dignitaries abroad . and technically the Marine corps doesn't really protect the president in a direct fashion that is up to the secret service security detail. the Marine Corps does however have the sole responsibility of transporting the president by helicopter to air force one or camp david or anywhere else he may need to go within reach of Marine 1 source.  If answer to #31 is correct, Trump can send in Marines without asking Congress.\n\n### What is Mueller's background? Military?\n\nMueller was accepted for officer training in the \nUnited States Marine Corps in 1968, attending \ntraining at Parris Island, Officer Candidate School, \nArmy Ranger School, and Army jump school. He \nenlisted in the U.S.M.C. and served in Marines from 1968-1971\n\n### Was Trump asked to run for President w/ assurances made to prevent tampering?\n\n### Who is helping POTUS?\n\nNSA and MI and aligned persons around the world in and out of governments/ngos and business.\n\n### How is POTUS always 5-steps ahead?\n\nExcellent intel from multiple sources: MI, NSA, Leaks\n\n### Who is helping POTUS?\n\nMilitary Intelligence, a network of persons in governments, business and organizations worldwide.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nThe Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) Military Intelligence look at 'State Secrets' and how upheld in the Supreme Court. Something must be completed to engage Military Intel over other (3) letter agencies. Something must occur to allow for civilian trials.\n\nFlynn has a military background. Adm Rogers (Dir., NSA) met Trump privately without authority. POTUS knows where the bodies are buried. POTUS has the goods on most bad actors. Trump was asked to run for President. Hillary was next in line. The election was suppose to be rigged. Good people prevented the rigging. POTUS formed a panel to investigate. Has POTUS *ever* made a statement that did not become proven as true/fact? Look who POTUS is in control of. Look to the one organization left that isn't corrupt.\n\nThe military plays such a vital role. POTUS is surrounded by highly respected generals. The Secret Service guards former Presidents. They guard Hillary. ANTIFA is allowed to operate. The Muslim Brotherhood hasn't been classified as a terrorist org. What if Soros funded operations get violent and engage in domestic terrorism? What happens if mayors/ police comms/chiefs do not enforce the law? What authority does POTUS have specifically over the Marines?\n\nLook at Mueller's background. Military. Trump was asked to run for President with assurances made to prevent tampering. POTUS is always 5-steps ahead. Someone is helping POTUS.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### SCI[F]\n\n### Military Intelligence\n\nMilitary Intelligence is the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). It is NOT a uniformed CIA, but liaisons with civilian agencies as needed. DIA operates in its own specific interests, coding and decoding enemy transmissions, assesssing enemy troop strengths, and processing intel as it pertains to wars, and the theaters, inc oceans, in which they are fought. Any intel they glean regarding plans of hostiles to harm USA is handeled by a joint operation liaisoning DIA to PENTAGON where the determinations are made in regards to disposition of this intel, and whom, by law, must be informed. All applicable offices liaison within the PENTAGON, thus the intel never physically leaves DIA chain of custody,\n\n### What is 'State Secrets' and how upheld in the SC?\n\nDefined as a test whereby the INT Control determines if it is necessary to protect the Republic and/or population. Can be challenged by SCOTUS under US v Reynolds by rule of majority of the bench.\n\nDocument detailing the procedure for invoking State Secrets privilege:\nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/legacy/2009/09/23/state-secret-privileges.pdf\n\n### What must be completed to engage MI over other (3) letter agencies?\n\nMI is military, other three-letter agencies are civilian. It would take an act of Congress to suspend Posse Comitatus. Martial law would also work.\n\n### What must occur to allow for civilian trials?\n\nA civilian trial must have a Judge who is willing to hear the case, an Attorney who is willing to prosecute and a Justice Department who is wiling to enforce a Judicial Warrant & Arrest Processing\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nIf all judges are corrupt, as MI / MI6 is finding in Ukraine, its impossible to enforce change. Therefore you must go to Tribunals and either flip the Supreme Court to enforce the proper changes to Arrest the Corrupt, or enact Martial Law and suspend the Criminal Code which is unenforceable so that the Military Code can take over prosecution; Military Tribunal being the backup “Safe Mode” for countries\n\n### What was Flynn's background?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n-General Flynn is part of a top secret group of highly skilled retired military operatives who have been investigating human trafficking for years. His company was cover. Flynn KNOWS. \n-He was \"blue-dying\" the GRU political spy network in Washington DC for Army / Navy INT. Sending a mole to light up the recruiters was the only way the FBI / MI5 were able to capture the Cambridge 6\n-POTUS conduit to uncorrupted MI\n-That is why he has been targeted, slandered, fired by Obama, fired on the advice of Pence and now still targeted so they hope he has no credibility.\n\n### Why did Adm R (NSA) meet Trump privately w/o auth?\n\n### Does POTUS know where the bodies are buried?\n\nExclusive: FBI agents raid headquarters of major U.S. body broker\n11-7-17\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bodies-fbi-exclusive/exclusive-fbi-agents-raid-headquarters-of-major-u-s-body-broker-idUSKBN1D72SL?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=Social\nhttps://archive.is/Mgf3v\n\n### Does POTUS have the goods on most bad actors?\n\n### Was TRUMP asked to run for President?\n\n### Why?\n\n### By Who?\n\nThe Deep State Patriots and MI Patriots who have been grooming him for years, since they knew he was interested in the possibility.  This is why he knows things nobody else does and is 5 steps ahead of those trying to subvert him.\n\n### Was HRC next in line?\n\nShe had the biggest favors to repay. Soft dollar commissions and political bribes work as a cash in, “political credit” entry ledger system. She took the cash, and promised like any NGO to ensure every favor was earmarked in order for her to get in. Most Democracies function only on who can pay off the most influence centers / “get out the vote” nexus actors. I suspect USA in reality is no different then India or Germany. She was the choice of the NWO\n\n### Was the election suppose to be rigged?\n\nIn a 2004 Congressional Committee on 2014 election and possible tampering with electronic voting machines, a  programmer named Clint Curtis testified that\nin 2000 he was approached by Yang Enterprises and asked to create a program to manipulate vote on electric voting machines to test them. The voter count would flip the loser to the winner, but it would only work if the vote was close. The 2000 election was very close, as was the 2004 election. There is video of his testimony around. There were some electronic voting irregularities in a few districts in the 2016 election, but they were found shortly after because the election wasn't close at all. Wasn't Yang a name that showed up during the Clinton admin in an alleged pay to play?\n\nWe know the voting machines were pre-programmed and people have already been Arrested in California, Nevada and NY State for voting multiple times / voter fraud that were paid for by HRC PAC’s\n\nProof:\n-LA County Admits Number Of Registered Voters At 144%\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-05/california-has-11-counties-more-registered-voters-voting-age-citizens\n\n-US has 35 Million More Registered Voters Than Live Adults - Red Flag for Electoral Fraud\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-18/us-has-35-million-more-registered-voters-live-adults-red-flag-electoral-fraud\n\n### Did good people prevent the rigging?\n\n### Why did POTUS form a panel to investigate?\n\nTo restore our voting process, and highlight the problems that exist in it. Especially the electronic voting machines, but also the usual dems getting the dead and the illegally present in our country to vote.\n\nTo see who really tried to hack election results in 21 states.  \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/politics/us-tells-21-states-that-hackers-targeted-their-voting-systems.html\n\"The government did not say who was behind the hacking attempts or provide details about what had been sought. But election officials in several states said the attempts were linked to Russia.\"\n\nWas it really Russia, or were operatives in Deep State doing the hacking under guise of Russia hacking \"fingerprints\" in order to FIX election for Hillary?\n\n### Has POTUS *ever* made a statement that did not become proven as true/fact?\n\n### What is POTUS in control of?\n\nEBS (Emergency Broadcast System) activation, Marshal Law Activation, declare federal level disasters, activate FEMA et al, allocate additional funding & resources\n\n### What is the one organization left that isn't corrupt?\n\nThe Military at large is the most trusted institution in the US, because it is comprised of mostly patriotic and loyal US citizens\n\n### Why does the military play such a vital role?\n\n-The military is under the control of POTUS, and can ACT QUICKLY without checks and balances from other parts of the government in the short term.  The military has corruption (see Naval Intelligence)\n-Military Code can allow for a Jury of Peers or lower Officers to press for the removal of a Executive Officer if he is unfit for Command and be relieved without need for Military Arrest or Serve of Warrant\n\n### Why is POTUS surrounded by highly respected generals?\n\nHe surrounded himself with people he knew he could trust, loyal to the oath.\n\n### Who guards former Presidents?\n\n### Why is that relevant?\n\n### Who guards HRC?\n\nSeptember 16, 2016 at rally in Miami, regarding HRC SS detail, Trump said \"Take their guns away, let's see what happens to her.\"\n\n### Why is ANTIFA allowed to operate?\n\nIt's a useful idiot and malcontent sponge to sop up radicals for monitoring and radicalization. Old FBI SOP from their KKK infiltration days\n\n### Why hasn't the MB been classified as a terrorist org?\n\nIt has significant funding and support from Campus Communist radicals who in turn get funding from Soros and GRU / PRC intelligence accounts; the two having overlapping objectives in destabilizing US morale and education effectiveness; Academics being useful targets due to their desire for ego and adventure / validation\n\n### What happens if Soros funded operations get violent and engage in domestic terrorism?\n\nSoros get hit with Civil Asset Forfeiture, jailed, identified as a terrorist globally.  It will take a small miracle from G&D to penetrate the 12+ shells between Soros and his front charities / useful proxies. If that occurs, tracing to the sourecs would freeze assets and jail him.\n\n### What happens if mayors/ police comms/chiefs do not enforce the law?\n\nWould be forced to declare martial law if State Police could not relieve the local PD & Judicial branch\n\n### What authority does POTUS have specifically over the Marines?\n\nNot just Marines, ALL military branches.  \n\nPOTUS can deploy military fro 60 days and 90 days.  Bush did this after 9-11.  That law was made because it would take too long for congress to declare war if there was an immediate threat.\nWar Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148\n\n### Why is this important?\n\nPOTUS can \"send in\" any military branch without asking congress.   The important thing about the Marines is they \n1) Have SOME of the transportation duties for POTUS \n2) Guard USA diplomats around the world.\n\nThe above is 60 days to 90 days.     According to section 2 clause 1 of the Constitution the President is \"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States\" and according to Section 8 clause 11 the Congress has the power \"To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water\". Historically the President has be able to use the Marines in any way he wants. They are his personal guard and answer to him.\n\n### What is Mueller's background? Military?\n\n### Was Trump asked to run for President w/ assurances made to prevent tampering?\n\n[SPECULATON] No, that would conflict with the admission WJC asked him to run as a Strawman for HRC\n\n### Who is helping POTUS?\n\n### How is POTUS always 5-steps ahead?\n\nBill Binney is likely assisting the POTUS and team with intelligence. Binney is a legend in meta data analysis and is a co author of a former NSA tool known as ThinThread. Recently Mike Pompeo (CIA) was advised by the POTUS to speak to Binney regarding the Russian hacking investigation. Binney would be able to tell who was responsible by running the data through ThinThread for sure but based on his own development of the algorithm used in the tool he could most likely look at the meta data himself and know. Not only would he know who the actors really were he would be able to develop a very detailed profile with an unknowable reach.\n\nBinney has been very critical of the NSA in the past however, its possible he (nor Snowden, Drake etc) were not aware of an inside threat from with in the government.\n\nBill Binney / ThinThread: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Binney_%28U.S._intelligence_official%29\n\nPOTUS to Pompeo:\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/11/07/politics/mike-pompeo-william-binney-meeting/index.html\n\nBinney Documentary:\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4065414/\n\n### Who is helping POTUS?\n\nHere are some of the big names backing POTUS. http://fortune.com/2016/08/03/trump-billionaire-backers-list/\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

Only Obama is out of office now, so that would be a violation of the Hatch Act. \n- He would know he must communicate in person, otherwise it will be known and gathered by SIGINT by the NSA. \n- One reason to set up the narrative he wants pushed regarding the trip, also he wants to find an opportunity to have Trump assassinated. \n- To know first hand exactly where POTUS goes while in Asia,  attempting to determine how much he actually knows, depending on who he talks to and where he visits.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nObama is usurping the President. Treason.\n\n### Focus on the power of POTUS as it relates to the Marines.\n\nMarine Corp is subject to Posse Comitatus (PC) under DoD regulations.

Pelosi's husband was a major investor in his company. \nhttp://freebeacon.com/politics/pelosi-subsidies-benefit-husbands-investment-in-dem-mega-donors-company/\n\n### Why is Pelosi’s memory going?\n\nA trick used to hope that they won't prosecute her or use it as a defense.\n\n### Could it protect against prosecution?\n\n-Though not typically a defense by itself, amnesia or dementia is a factor courts can consider when determining whether someone is competent to stand trial (Mental fitness)\n-Yes; Mental Ability plea. You cant punish a invalid or mental insane case.\n\n### What is the Mayo Clinic?\n\nAccording to wiki, The Mayo Clinic is a nonprofit medical practice and medical research group based in Rochester, Minnesota. It employs more than 4,500 physicians and scientists and 57,100 allied health staff. The practice specializes in treating difficult cases through tertiary care. It spends over $660 million a year on research. However, some speculate it may participate in organ harvesting.\n\n### Who sits on the BOD there?\n\nBarbara Bush, Dick Cheney, Cokie Roberts, Jeffery W Bolton, Eric Schmidt, Walter Mondale, Ursula Burns (direct Obama connection), Alan Mulally (direct Obama connection)\n\n### What if John M's surgery was fake?\n\nIf fake, he's setting himself up to avoid prosecution and/or testifying anywhere.\n\n### Why would this occur?\n\nIn order to preclude criminal culpability in court, i.e., Mental fitness issue\n\n### What could this prevent potentially?\n\nProsecution\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nObama traveled in advance of POTUS to foreign locations. Focus on the power of POTUS as it relates to the Marines. Military Intel can be applied to prosecute bad actors and avoid corrupt agencies and judges. Mueller met POTUS 1 day prior to FBI announcement, but COULD NOT be offered director due to prev term limits rule. Pelosi is begging for a new special counsel.\n\nLook at Pelosi's net worth. This couldn't be obtained given salary as career official. Pelosi's memory is going. It could protect against prosecution. Look at the Mayo Clinic. The Board of Directors are corrupt. John M's surgery was fake. This could prevent prosecution.\n\n### >>147443190\n\nhttps://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/147433975/#q147443190\n\n### Why do D’s want to control the black pop?\n\nKeep them voting D\n--As it is the perfect victim population that is very sensitive to perceived threats and very predictable in how they will respond as long as you have some lenses to focus that rage.\n-That victim group is used as a proxy to attack normal Americans, without the DNC doing so directly.\n\n### Why do they intentionally keep poor and in need?\n\nKeep them voting D\n- Aggression, depression, and disaffection can be bred into the controlled ghetto's to culture a human explosive.\n\n### Why do D’s project racism on a daily basis against R’s?\n\nKeep them voting D\n- As unfortunately the cultural reaction is predictable. Rage, riots, deaths and chaos. \nD's NEED victims, as it is no use simply shouting fire you must also be the one opening the door you want them to go through\n\n### Why do black elected officials do the crazy talk on behalf of D’s?\n\nSo it's not a white (or a jew) D telling blacks how to vote. \n- Black officials stir up and focus injustice that they themselves provide and do not suffer. It allows events such as the NFL or BLM to occur with apparent spontaneity allowing political pressure to prevent police and destroy authority keeping the Dems to have access to drug trade and other trafficking routes needed by the CIA and FBI\n\n### How do D’s cover the historical facts of forming the confederacy, KKK, and oppose all things pro black re: legislation?\n\n- They tell the lie that the parties switched.\n-Through control of curriculum and textbooks, build the false history\n- Through being the majority of teachers and professors, propagandize and reinforce the propaganda all through a person's education\n-Through audio/visual media, countless movies and documentaries portraying a false history\n- Through \"outreach\" programs and party platform portray their own party as the protector and provider of the black population\n\n### What happens if D’s lose the slave grip on the black pop?\n\nD's lose power forever\n-The Blacks, like Latinos will gravitate back towards the libertarian / right wing (like Ukrainians and Polish did when the USSR lost their hold over the Deep State USSR proxies)\n\n### Why do D’s, through the funding of the CIA, prop up and install Hollywood/media assets?\n\nAnother method of propaganda that gives them easy access to a large portion of the population.\n\nYou need control over the message at all times. Controlling the flow of all news and entertainment in an age of media gives ultimate control.\n\nPolitics is Downstream from Culture.  Hollywood,et al creates popular culture\n\n### Does this fall within Operation Mockingbird?\n\nYes\n\n### What were the historical advantages D’s gained by having MSM and famous people peddling narrative?\n\nControl of propaganda and the narrative.\n\n### Who exposed the pedo network within H wood?\n\n- Ronan Farrow\n- Corey Feldman, though he did not name names until recently.\n- Rose McGowan recently\n- Robert Downy Jr. (as Himmmm on https://CrazyDaysandNights.net) \n- Amy Berg's documentary \"An Open Secret\"\n- Elle Magazine Article: Amy Berg Uncovered Hollywood's Worst Kept Sex Secret\n- Roseanne Barr \n- Pamela Anderson (via Julian Assange and WikiLeaks)\n- Justin Bieber\n- McKulley Kulken\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nDemocrats want to control the black population. They intentionally keep them poor and in need. Democrats project racism on a daily basis against Republicans. Black elected officials do the crazy talk on behalf of Democrats. Democrats cover the historical facts of forming the confederacy, KKK, and oppose all things pro black regarding legislation. What happens if Democrats lose the slave grip on the black pop. Democrats, through the funding of the CIA, prop up and install Hollywood/media assets. This does fall within Operation Mockingbird.\n\nThere are historical advantages that Democrats gained by having MSM and famous people peddling the narrative. Someone exposed the pedophile network within Hollywood.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### Why does Obama travel in advance of POTUS to foreign locations?\n\n[Theory] Obama & Valerie work with local CIA rogue elements and patsy political operatives to promote malcontent and hinder State Dept diplomacy. \n- Acts as a “shadow government” to create conflict ex: call in “favors” from judges, as seen in Immigration Ban with judge from Hawaii. Money laundering as seen with Clinton Foundation.\n- \"...effective September 1, 2017, US Passports were invalidated for travel into, on, or through North Korea.\" Implying that Obama either traveled to NK illegally, had Trump's approval, or did not travel on a US passport.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nNote that Sessions shut off 2 illegal and unconstitutional SLUSH FUNDS, one belonging to the DOJ, and another to the EPA. They were used under the BO admin for what?  \n1. EPA : How Jeff Sessions is Stopping the EPA's Slush Fund\nhttp://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/347148-how-jeff-sessions-is-stopping-the-epas-slush-fund   \nhttps://archive.is/ik5vs\n\n2.

Also, other connections could be revealed depending on where Obama goes and who he talks to. Could reveal where other ties and connections lie.\n\n### Focus on the power of POTUS as it relates to the Marines.\n\nMarines Are Commanded by Robert Neller.  Nellar answers to DOD Chief Mattis, also USMC ret.  Mattis answers to POTUS.  The center of power is Washngton D.C.  District of.Columbia is not a State.  Marines can and will protect the center of power.  \n\nAs outlined in 10 U.S.C. § 5063 and as originally introduced under the National Security Act of 1947, three primary areas of responsibility for the Marine Corps are:\n1. Seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns;\n2. Development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by amphibious landing forces in coordination with the Army and Air Force; and\n3. Such other duties as the President or Department of Defense may direct.\n\nThis last clause derives from similar language in the Congressional acts \"For the Better Organization of the Marine Corps\" of 1834, and \"Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps\" of 1798. In 1951, the House of Representatives' Armed Services Committee called the clause \"one of the most important statutory – and traditional – functions of the Marine Corps.\" It noted that the Corps has more often than not performed actions of a non-naval nature, including its famous actions in Tripoli, the War of 1812, Chapultepec, and numerous counter-insurgency and occupational duties.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps\n\n### How can MI be applied to prosecute bad actors and avoid corrupt agencies and judges?\n\n### Why did Mueller meet POTUS 1-day prior to FBI announcement if Mueller COULD NOT be offered director due to prev term limits rule?\n\nRobert Mueller was a former Special Prosecutor who worked on complex financial fraud cases with UK Intelligence’s Special Crimes / Major Crimes Unit. He worked on tracking international money laundering, specifically targeting the Chinese Pay to Play crimes in the 1990’s\n\n### Why is Pelosi begging for a new special counsel?\n\nPelosi and Frank were 4 of the largest money laundering conduits for the 2001-2008 \nsubprime scandal, Pelosi also has been under investigation for major green card fraud, most of which was sponsored by major tech / DARPA backed tech oligarchs\n\n### What is Pelosi’s net worth?\n\n### How was this obtained given salary as career official?\n\n### Why is Pelosi’s memory going?\n\nnon compos mentis (not mentally capable)\n\nPelosi suffers brain freeze while questioning Trump's fitness to be President\nhttp://www.theamericanmirror.com/pelosi-suffers-brain-freeze-questioning-trumps-fitness-president/\n\n### Could it protect against prosecution?\n\nnon compos mentis (not mentally capable)\n\n### What is the Mayo Clinic?\n\nA VIP hospital who works on Heads of State and anyone who can pay for a surgery which may not be legal under medical insurance / surgeon boards. This is important when working on foreign heads of state who may be legally not allowed to enter the USA.Add: Doc here, the Mayo clinic is revered as the world 'center' of surgical excellence. If you are a foreign billionaire this is where you would pay to go.\n\n### Who sits on the BOD there?\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/governance/trustees\n\n### What if John M's surgery was fake?\n\nYes, without question. John is still working great on the Intelligence Committee. \n-Doc here.. I am not a neurosurgeon but his rapid recovery suggests that he didn't actually have anything significant done. As this trick applies to Pelosi, claim memory loss, dementia etc so they can’t testify.\n\n### Why would this occur?\n\nNB - As Criminal Scandals Implicating McCain Unfold 'Declining' Health Has Become an Off-Broadway Production\nhttp://truepundit.com/as-criminal-scandals-implicating-mccain-unfold-declining-health-has-become-an-off-broadway-production/\n\n### What could this prevent potentially?\n\nJon would either be forced to admit the Congressional Intelligence Committee is compromised and by extension the CIA/NSA/FBI/DNI/NRO were also compromised since 1991 (which would have explained the large layoffs and retribution for the success in Yugoslavia by Russian/Chinese actors) or commit perjury.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n### >>147443190\n\nID:grTMpzrL Wed 01 Nov 2017 00:29:28\n\n### Why do D’s want to control the black pop?\n\nCommunists in 1940 theorized that the Blacks were the Ukrainians of USA. They lacked a way to infiltrate because nobody knew how Black Culture worked. Democrats always needed a useful idiot class to be their “Bohemian Majority” and be their Useful idiots to sway the Overton Window leftward.\n\n### Why do they intentionally keep poor and in need?\n\nDependency on the Government and in return they are controllable\n\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs. If you are too busy worrying about basic needs, you don't think long term or in terms of moral parameters.\n\n### Why do D’s project racism on a daily basis against R’s?\n\n-Alinsky \"Rules for Radicals\" 101: Project to deflect\n-Division is strategy for conquering a people. -Division can also lead to civil war/unrest -- from that \"crisis\" arises the \"demand\" for a new world government to \"save\" us.\n\n### Why do black elected officials do the crazy talk on behalf of D’s?\n\nThe Black Caucus are all bribed and paid off, which was the whole reason the Blacks were allowed into office under Rev. Al Sharpton’s Pac network, financed by the big Tobacco DNC interests circa 1990\n\n### How do D’s cover the historical facts of forming the confederacy, KKK, and oppose all things pro black re: legislation?\n\nMost U.S.history textbooks in US public middle, high schools and universities have a liberal slant.  For example, the \"Radical Republicans\" of  the Reconstruction era are painted in a subtly negative light, so as to infer \"40 acres and a mule\" for slave restitution was a bad thing. Similarly most, but not all, public school teachers are of a liberal bent and their union PACs always endorse Democrats.  Public schools have thus become well-oiled propaganda machines breeding and ensuring massive liberal mindsets effectively indoctrinating the young people with propaganda and a mindset that is in harmony with the cabal's agenda.  Investigating the names of the editors of a textbook will reveal their political leanings and explain why the textbook is politicized.\n\n### What happens if D’s lose the slave grip on the black pop?\n\n### Why do D’s, through the funding of the CIA, prop up and install Hollywood/media assets?\n\nOnly thing money can not control is spread of truth online. This combined with memetics, Streissand efect and the fact, that viral content can exponentially multiply, cause the truth to spread faster than any \"fake news truth\" can be spread on shill media.\n\n### Does this fall within Operation Mockingbird?\n\nIt's become very obvious that the media immediately calls up people like Al Sharpton to crow about grievances and accuse anyone who questions their narrative as being a racist bigot. Every single issue that can be twisted to condition the black population into thinking the \"white mans system\" is out to get them is employed by these \"race-baiters\" the media puts forth. It is obvious that it is coordinated.\n\n### What were the historical advantages D’s gained by having MSM and famous people peddling narrative?\n\nCult of Personality and Endorsement are circular references since the 1940’s and the “Camelot Presidency”. Without manipulating consumer preferences and consumption habits, it’s hard to gain the populations trust on tougher concepts like wealth destruction and tax hikes\n\n### Who exposed the pedo network within H wood?\n\nAmy Berg, Director of \"Open Secret\" (2014) Oscar nominated for Deliver Us From Evil about an Irish priest pedophile for which she was Oscar nominated. Producers with the original Hollywood pedophile idea for the film were Gabe Hoffman (hedge fund mgr) and Michael Valentinas (entertainment lawyer) who said \"I came up with the idea hearing Corey Feldman talk about what he'd been through,\" referring to Feldman's revelations in interviews that he and others had been sexually abused as child actors.  \nsource: http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a19842/true-detective/\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

The meetings with the non-military (civilian) could have included the military, however, the military's own meeting would not have included the non-military.\n\n### Why were certain rooms in the WH renovated? Clear bugs and tracking devices.\n\nBecause numerous leaks came out of Trump's meetings in the WH starting after inauguration, and phone calls were leaked too.

The Office of \nContingency and the Disaster Government (shadow gov) which became a full time program within the White House in the PATRIOT, 2005 edition ensured there is always a plan for everything. SAPs operate on a different system then the DNI setup, which allows them to work on their own training and infrastructure grid. This is relevant if you think back to how the original 1788 militas were founded.\n\n### Who can be held hostage and controlled?\n\nIllegal enemy combatants. Military Commissions Act of 2006, a bill which suspended habeas corpus for any alien determined to be an \"unlawful enemy combatant engaged in hostilities or having supported hostilities against the United States.      In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States Congress passed a resolution known as the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) on 18 September 2001. In this, Congress invoked the War Powers Resolution and stated:\n\n    That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons\n\n### CIA thinks its foreign offshore assets are strong enough to defend against the US executive (not accounting for military use on domestic soil).\n\nNot necessarily.

The 1940’s Deep State knew that eventually the enemies of the USA and NATO would find a way into even the deepest citadel bunkers and there must be a necessary method to reboot the whole network in the event the Communist infection was impossible to contain or isolate from the SAPs & the corruption started to affect the “American dream”. There was legitimate concern that should the Mafia be purchased by a foreign power, or a foreign govt find a way to buy a POTUS, the Republic would be doomed and it would only be a matter of time before someone figured out how to defeat CIA/DIA’s failsafes and FBI’s counter programs\n\n### Some things must remain classified to the very end.

In churches, on campuses, in classrooms, in public meetings, they took notes, tape-recorded, and photographed people who dissented in thought, word, or deed. This included clergymen, editors, public officials, and anyone who sympathized with the dissenters.\nhttp://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6053&context=lalrev\n\n>Hahahaha, Trump has had MI infiltrate Antifa and all the dissenting local govts. \n\nAlways 5 steps ahead!\n\nPlease be true.\n\n### Well done.

Sitting president committed treason.\n\n### Where is BO today?\n\nFinding BHO is impossible using standard internet.\n\n### Did BO and/or his admin ever make false statements that U1 would never be exported from the US?\n\nNot in the Administration, but Oilprice.com reported the US NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) had not granted Russia licesnces to export uranium from the US (https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Does-Russia-Really-Own-20-Of-The-US-Uranium-Reserves.html). Apparently Senator John Barrasso (R-WY, where most of U1 is) tried to warn Obama that the Russians did not have or request the correct licenses but that uranium had been shipped to Canada. He said he was ignored. (http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/417425/barrasso-uranium-has-left-united-states-i-worry-about-iran-getting-uranium-jim)\n\n### Who made those statements?\n\nNRC told WY Sen. John Barasso that the uranium would not be exported. After John Christensen saw uranium leaving Uranium One on his property, Donna Wichers (Uranium One spokeswoman) said the uranium was taken to Canada for processing and 75% returned to the US, the rest to Japan & Western Europe. (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html)\n\n### Who did they report to?\n\nChairman of NRC is appointed by the President and serves at his pleasure.

Obama and/or his administration made false statements that Uranium 1 would never be exported from the US. Someone made those statements. Someone they report to. The public has been given a select taste - rest assured others have it all.\n\nThe CIA controls the narrative. Left wing organizations are beginning to report on DNC/Democrat corruption.

Why is this relevant?\n\n### Who controls the narrative?\n\n### Why are left wing organizations beginning to report on DNC/D corruption?\n\n-HRC is being hung out to dry\n-Donna Brazile's book being published.\n-The strings that control the left wing organizations are being cut.\n- If those \"above you\" are taken down, you have more freedom.\n\n### Does the CIA have operators inside the MSM?\n\n### What happens if exposed?\n\nMSM goes down.  Shock and awe will affect the public at large. Proves POTUS is right about fake news. FCC could shut them down. Rise of internet related news continues exponentially.\n\n### What happens if tied back as 'knowing' to execs?\n\nTrump Tweet 10/11/17: \"With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!\" \n\nIf the executives knowingly disseminated false information, would they lose their licenses and/or open themselves up to criminal and/or civil prosecution? On a larger scale, treason?\n\n### What does this have to do with 'leaking'?\n\nPerfectly illustrated in the television series \"House of Cards.\" President uses reporter Zoe Barnes this way.\n\n### What if it can be verified no sourced stories (made up) were in fact (and approved) to be published?\n\nLoss of broadcast license, Potential for civil or criminal charges. \n\nIt then becomes who created the stories and by what orders and from whom.

It is the most permissive clearance granted by the United States Government, acting as the sole means of access to the vast compartmentalizations Top Secret and Secret Restricted Data, and DOE \"security\" areas.\n\n### What hint does that explicitly refer to?\n\nClearance explicitly refers to nuclear information. Implying those with such access were aware of the U1 movements, as well as potentially NK & IRAN nuclear activity\n\n### DOE?\n\nDepartment of Energy\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nCompartmentalization of information. Specification is necessary, accuracy is important.\n\n### Who would have the goods on U1?\n\nThe DOE would control the labs which control the uranium stockpile. Whoever wanted the transfer would have to go through the DOE, including people with Q clearances\n\n### Does stating 'Q' refer that person works in DOE?\n\nImplication is yes\n\n### No.\n\n### Does it refer that someone dropping such information has the highest level of security within all departments?\n\nNot necessarily. Those with Q clearances cannot access information outside of their department without \"need to know\". It's equivalent is TS/SCI, which is still “need to know”\n\n### (May 2010) BO \"Russia should be viewed as a friendly partner under Section 123 the Atomic Energy Act of 1954\" after agreeing to a new nuclear weapons reduction deal and helping US w/ Iran. Who is the enemy?\n\nThe Obama administration didn't seem to veiw any country as \"enemies.\"  The vague \"terrorists\" or \"extremists\" were the \"enemy.\"\n\nNow the narrative has shifted--D's pushing that Russia is our mortal enemy; blaming Russia for HRC loss. Russia is now more useful as a scapegoat for D finger-pointing.\n\n### What is being continually stated by all D's?\n\n-Russia is a hostile force\n-Russia hacked the DNC server; \n-Russia and Trump are in collusion; \n-Russia influenced the presidential election\n\n### Russia is what?\n\nDangerous, our enemy, committing cyber attacks, involved in our elections\nCompetition for the US as a global superpower.\n\n### What did the Russia reset really provide?\n\n-Hillary Clinton as SOS access on a different level\n-The Clintons, they get their donations and speaking fees in the millions of dollars. The Russians get access to advanced US technology. The tech companies [that participated in the reset, including Cisco, Intel, Microsoft] get special access to the Russian market and workforce.\n\nhttp://nypost.com/2016/07/31/report-raises-questions-about-clinton-cash-from-russians-during-reset/\n\n### Clearance/pathway to complete the U1 deal?\n\nYes.\n\n### Why is the Canadian PM so important?\n\nCanadian PM matters because if the U1 material went through Canada, he would have to have been made aware of it. PM from 2006 - 2015 was Stephen Harper (b. 1959). From 2015 to present Justin Trudeau (b. 1971)\n\n### They never thought they were going to lose.\n\n### The calm before the storm\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nLook at Q Clearance, explicitly to DOE. Someone has the goods on Uranium 1. Stating 'Q' don't refer that person works in DOE. It refers that someone dropping such information has the highest level of security within all departments.\n\nObama: \"Russia should be viewed as a friendly partner under Section 123 the Atomic Energy Act of 1954\" after agreeing to a new nuclear weapons reduction deal and helping US with Iran. There is an enemy. Look at what is being continually stated by all democrates. The Russia reset provided a clearance/pathway to complete the Uranium 1 deal.\n\nThe Canadian Prime Minister is so important. They never thought they were going to lose.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### What is Q Clearance?\n\nAllows access to Classified information up to and including TOP SECRET data with the special designation: Restricted Data (TS//RD) and special Q-Cleared \"security\" areas Such as, The White House, The Pentagon, The Hall of Congress and the Supreme Court Room of the United States Federal Government. This level of clearance is granted alongside L Clearance, This level of clearance is also specifically granted to very few members of government, such as the current President of the United States, The Secretary of Defense, The Secretary of Homeland Security, all four- and five-star generals and admirals in the U.S. military, and all former Presidents of the United States.\n\n### What hint does that explicitly refer to?\n\n### DOE?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### Who would have the goods on U1?\n\nCould be DOE head: Steven Chu, Daniel Poneman, Ernest Moniz, were all Sec. DOE appointed by BO; Current is Perry. Poneman was the interim in between Chu and Moniz appointments.\n\n### Does stating 'Q' refer that person works in DOE?\n\n### No.\n\nQ clearance indeed... EnQuire Group is an elite hacking cyber security unit with the NSA. No stone left unturned with this group of trojan horses. Everything is exposed to them as they define the descriptive narrative given to Black Hat communities. This super secret group has been exposed as also being involved in COINTEL operations for the NSA and is known as the \"Q Group\" within industry circles..\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.amp.html\n\n\"“TheShadowBrokers is wanting to see you succeed,” the post said, addressing Mr. Trump. “TheShadowBrokers is wanting America to be great again.”\n\nQ Patriot could be a NSA insider who doubles as an agent within the Shadow Brokers group.\n\n### Does it refer that someone dropping such information has the highest level of security within all departments?\n\nYes .\n\n### (May 2010) BO \"Russia should be viewed as a friendly partner under Section 123 the Atomic Energy Act of 1954\" after agreeing to a new nuclear weapons reduction deal and helping US w/ Iran. Who is the enemy?\n\n### What is being continually stated by all D's?\n\n\"Russia INTERFERED in our election.\" Consistent, ad nauseum use of the word 'interfered.'\n\n### Russia is what?\n\nRussia has historically been the perceived arch-rival and pure nemesis of the United States for over seventy years, meaning virtually every age group in America generally believes the same things about Russia.  \n\n-On the other hand Putin rejects NWO and promotes national sovereignty. Two things in common with DJT\n-Positioned to be an energy superpower( gas, oil,  uranium) see 2012 book 'the colder war'. Putin has also supported the revival of Christian faith within Russia and frequently emphasizes its importance for a moral and sustainable society.\n\n### What did the Russia reset really provide?\n\nThe Russia reset provided a clearance/pathway to the U1 deal for the Clintons and others.\n\n### Clearance/pathway to complete the U1 deal?\n\n### Why is the Canadian PM so important?\n\n### They never thought they were going to lose.\n\n### The calm before the storm\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

What is the annual salary of a sitting US president?\n\n### What home(s) were just purchased by BO?\n\nThe Obama's just bought the house in D.C. that they had been renting since they left the White House. Purchased the home for $8.1 million.\n\n### How does it reconcile?\n\nFat book deal advance, speaking engagement fees.\n\n### What is the net worth of Pelosi?\n\n### How doe sit reconcile?\n\n### What is the John M Institute?\n\nSeems to operate in the same manner as the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative\n\n### Notice any patterns relating to the CF?\n\n### Where did John M obtain his surgery?\n\n### Why is that relevant?\n\n### What surgery did he supposedly have?\n\nSurgery for glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer with fast progression and high mortality rate. Glioblastoma is progressive, debilitating (loss of physical and cognitive function) and generally lethal.\n\n### How many days until he was back in Congress and sitting on the OS comm?\n\n-Doc here again, it was a few days and supposed to be a giolblastoma (brain cancer). That is a big surgery that would have kept him out for a long time. Two week recovery time is very suspicious and unrealistic.\n\n-No reason to be the cause of an achilles tendon rupture - also the boot he is in is not suitable for Achilles repair (needs to be in 30 degree flexion for at least 2 weeks)\n\n### What is John M's net worth?\n\n### How does it reconcile?\n\nMrs. Cindy McCain inherited majority control and became chair of Hensley & Co., one of the largest Anheuser-Busch beer distributors in the United States.  She's involved \"stopping human trafficking\". She is worth $100 million.\n\n### What is Maxine Waters net worth?\n\nHer house is $4 million\n\n### How does it reconcile?\n\nHow do they get so rich?\n-Like Congress's questionable trading practices, mixing real estate investments with taxpayer money is technically legal. Actually, it's pretty easy for members of Congress to get rich off of federal projects — land deals are more difficult to detect than trades, and land, unlike stocks, doesn't have a set price. Members of Congress aren't required to disclose if a land deal would benefit them personally.\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/congress-insider-trading-earmarks-real-estate-nancy-pelosi-rich-tax-payer-money-2011-11?op=1/#use-minority-leader-nancy-pelosi-d-ca-1\n\n### What does swamp refer to?\n\nThe Swamp: Washington's Murky Pool of Corruption and Cronyism\nDeep State. Both elected and un-elected individuals who exert massive influence in U.S. Government. These entities answer to no one but each other and therefore maintain a \"shadow\" government. Not restricted to Washington, plenty of foreign actors/agents e.g. Alwaleed bin Talal, Soros.\n\n### What does money buy?\n\nUnethical or illegally sourced medical life extension (organs, young blood serum, harvested stem cells)\n\n.\n\n### Alice & Wonderland.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

Part of this funding arises through the zakat (an act of charity dictated by Islam) paid by all Saudis to charities, and amounting to at least 2.5% of their income. Although many charities are genuine, others allegedly serve as fronts for money laundering and terrorist financing operations.

Too fast, too directed, no political donations listed.\n\n### How does HS interact w/ TSA?\n\n### What updated post 9-11 protocols were put in place to prevent/stop inbound/outbound C-level targets?\n\n(Not sure what a \"c level threat is, but this is a list of some of the post 9-11 changes.) Since the new regulations came fairly quickly, the goals were set in short and long terms. According to Jim Abrams, some of the short term goals included \"criminal background checks on 750,000 airport employees, the presence of more law enforcement, the screening of all checked baggage with whatever means available, including X-ray machines and hand inspections, the placement of more air marshals on flights, and more passengers will be pre-screened, with more cross-checking with FBI and other watch lists for suspicious passengers\" (2001). As of 2003, the department of Homeland Security, headed by Tom Ridge, made the decision to increase the number of air marshals by 5,000 (Regional, 2003). Those short-term affects were to happen within the first year of implementation. The long term affects of the new security on airlines were: \"A new Transportation Department agency put in place to oversee all transportation security measures, all 28,000 airport baggage screeners [are] federal workers, all checked baggage is to be inspected with explosives detection machines, [and] Trusted-passenger programs will be implemented, using new technologies to identify passengers and expedite screening\" (Abrams, 2001). Most of the new regulations proposed security of the baggage and the passengers on the plane. According to the TSA, as quoted in the article by Gerald L. Dillingham, \"[The TSA has] confiscated more than 4.8 million prohibited items (including firearms, knives, and incendiary or flammable objects) from passengers\" (2003, p. 8). The Department of Homeland Security has also backed up this fact by stating \"airport screeners have, since February 2002, intercepted more than 7.8 million items, including 1,437 firearms, 2.3 million knives, and 49,331 box cutters - the terrorists' weapon of choice on 9-11. Attempts at concealment included razor blades hidden in tennis shoes\" (Gips, 2003). http://www.ifpo.org/resource-links/articles-and-reports/protection-of-specific-environments/the-evolution-of-airline-security-since-911/\n\n### What local airports are in close proximity to DC?\n\n### What happened shortly after 9-11 (specifically with all aircraft)?\n\nFAA Rapid Response Team on Aircraft Security created, recommends the hardening of existing cockpit doors and expediting the design, production and installation of new doors.\n\n### Who was authorized to depart? ONLY 1 PLANE was authorized during this 'mandatory forced grounding'.\n\nThere were several flights.\n\nThe first leg of this flight took place at 1:30pm. The purpose of this leg was to bring young Saudi noblemen studying in Florida from Raytheon Airport Services, a private jet hangar at TPA (Tampa INT) to Blue Grass Airport (LEX GA). The airplane was a 10-person Learjet. There is no manifest or record. The FAA claims this flight did not occur and has no record of it despite sworn affidavits that it did occur by Federal personnel.\n\nAt the same time, several other flights to transport Saudi noblemen and princes were authorized by FAA with the eventual goal of transporting these individuals, which included Osama Bin Ladin's sister, to Las Vegas for a direct flight.\n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2004/03/11/unger_1/\n\n### Who SPECIFICALLY authorized this?\n\nBen Sliney on first day of the job.

Also shields Soros' fortune from estate tax upon George's death (which clearly he is eluding via 'special' medical treatment)\n\n### Can it be used by bad actors (escape, bribes, rogue contractors, etc.)?\n\n### Slush fund?\n\nCharity watchdog: Clinton Foundation a ‘slush fund’\nhttp://nypost.com/2015/04/26/charity-watchdog-clinton-foundation-a-slush-fund/\n\n### Did the US gov't seize/stop/track other slush funds that prevent or create risk to operate?\n\n### Why did JK travel to SA recently?\n\nNegotiating Peace in the Middle East: Key to solving that dispute is Egypt.

Alice & Wonderland.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### What was POTUS' last Tweet (prior to)?\n\nI will be interviewed by @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews at 10:00. Enjoy!\n18:29 - 2. Nov. 2017\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/926260114146889728\n\nThe @TuckerCarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great FBI was so sad to watch. James Comey's leadership was a disaster!\n18:26 - 2. Nov. 2017\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/926259330474704900\n\n### To who was it addressed?\n\n### When was POTUS' Twitter taken down?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### What was POTUS' last Tweet (prior to)?\n\n### Who was it addressed to specifically?\n\nSaudi King? Prince? Saudi Arabia itself?\n\n### When was POTUS' Twitter taken down? Has this ever happened before?\n\n### Why now?\n\n### Coincidence?\n\n### How many times did the attack occur (secondary clean up)?\n\n### What is the purpose of tracking?\n\nTo locate where someone is; hunt and find.\n\n### What is the purpose of disruption?\n\n### Why did POTUS have military guards (uniform) while in HI?\n\nSS believed compromised. Not trusted to protect POTUS. Minimize chance of 'internal' assassination attempts'. Signal to others / warning to SS - awareness of compromised SS? Military not corrupt\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nTo show that Trump has the full backing of the Military and that the Military can be trusted to be around Trump.\n\nBefore Trump's inauguration, Obama tried to rally the Military behind him, to prevent Trump from taking office.  But that failed when Obama realizes that Trump already has the full backing of the military.\n\n### Do military guards (uniform) typically assist the USSS?\n\nDuring wartime the US SS needs the assistance of the MI to be effective.  \"Protecting the president of the United States is a mission that should be carried out and presided over by only the most highly qualified individuals. And right now, when we are fighting an enemy that is both capable and determined to attack the homeland, including the White House, those individuals should include the men and women of the U.S. military, working in coordination with the Secret Service.\" Sept 2014 \nhttp://archive.is/KfdxF\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nTrump needs extra security; the SS cannot totally be trusted\n\n### What flying object was recently shot down?\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen, who have been fighting Saudi-backed forces there for several years, claimed responsibility for firing the ballistic missile on Saturday. The missile traveled more than 500 miles before Saudi Arabia intercepted it.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency charged that debris from the missile proved that it was made in Iran and smuggled into Yemen. American officials have previously alleged that Iran has armed the Houthi rebels. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/07/saudi-arabia-calls-missile-launch-act-war-by-iran-vows-retaliation.html\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nSaudi national Guard Deploys Attack Helicopters as Border Situation Deteriorates\nhttps://proeliumlaw.com/saudi-national-guard-deploys-attack-helicopters-as-border-situation-deteriorates/\n\n### How precise is geo tracking (non-public c-level pro)?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nAlso someone is (or is capable of) hunting Trump via his Twitter\n-CIA\n\n### Alice & Wonderland.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

Why didn't Comey drop this?\n\nWeiner's laptop/New Clinton emails was enough to not shut the case down, but McCabe blocked further investigation.\n\n### Who was the FBI director during the Haiti crisis? How many kids disappeared?\n\nJames Comey. \n550,000 children missing\n\n### How much money was sent to CF under disguise of Haiti relief and actually went to Haiti?\n\nEstimated $30,000,000+\n\nCF held back 10% of donations, then awarded money to their cronies to \"rebuild\" Haiti.  Bill Clinton was very influential in directing funds.  It's possible money stayed under CF umbrella and cycled through their \"initiates\" until all money was gone.  Also, Bill pressured banks to back rebuild project. They wrote off loss when rebuild failed.\n\n### What countries donated big money to CF?\n\nAustralia, Saudi Arabia, Norway, Netherlands, Canada\n\n### SA?\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has given between $10 million and $25 million since the foundation was created in 1999. Part of that came in 2014, although the database doesn’t specify how much. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/38805\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n- Large amounts of funds were given by KSA to CF, \n- CF was involved with Haiti earthquake situation \n- CF involved in \"girls & women's\" programs there, \n- Children went \"missing\" from Haiti\n- Huma A kept HRC abreast of Laura Silsby's situation in Haiti (arrested for human trafficking of Haitian children)\n- Presents indication the CF was involved with human trafficking using KSA money, possibly intended delivery of children to KSA\n\n### Snow White\n\nSpy Vs.

Why didn't Comey drop this?\n\n### Who was the FBI director during the Haiti crisis? How many kids disappeared?\n\n### How much money was sent to CF under disguise of Haiti relief and actually went to Haiti?\n\nFrom a Townhall Article: \"Those billions intended to rebuild the ruined nation instead disappeared into fantasy houses and roads that were never built, jobs that were never created, a national revival that never happened, and often  private bank accounts never traceable. And a company with Tony Rodham, Hillary’s brother, on the board, somehow scored a lucrative 25-year gold mining deal.\" (https://townhall.com/columnists/joyoverbeck/2016/09/03/hillary-cares-about-you-ask-the-haitians-she-ripped-off-n2213504)\n\n### What countries donated big money to CF?\n\nAt least four foreign countries gave to the foundation in 2013—Norway, Italy, Australia and the Netherlands—a fact that has garnered little attention. The number of governments contributing in 2014 appears to have doubled from the previous year. Since its founding, the foundation has raised at least $48 million from overseas governments, according to a Journal tally. United Arab Emirates, a first-time donor, gave between $1 million and $5 million in 2014, and the German government—which also hadn’t previously given—contributed between $100,000 and $250,000. A previous donor, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has given between $10 million and $25 million since the foundation was created in 1999. Part of that came in 2014, although the database doesn’t specify how much. The Australian government has given between $5 million and $10 million, at least part of which came in 2014. It also gave in 2013, when its donations fell in the same range. Qatar’s government committee preparing for the 2022 soccer World Cup gave between $250,000 and $500,000 in 2014. Qatar’s government had previously donated between $1 million and $5 million. Oman, which had made a donation previously, gave an undisclosed amount in 2014. Over time, Oman has given the foundation between $1 million and $5 million. Prior to last year, its donations fell in the same range. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/38805\n\n### SA?\n\nSA gave Clinton Foundation $40million 2001-2015.  CF tax returns late to be amended.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### Snow White\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

MS13 member, likely\n\n### Was there only one shooter?\n\nNo. Multiple shooters. [theory]\n\n### Why was JFK released?\n\nTo show the public how presidential assassinations are planned by multiple groups\n\n### What do the JFK files infer?\n\nThat the CIA has operated unchecked since after the Second World War, and that the FBI has been their cover-up team and protector since J Edgar walked across the carpet in his office in high heel shoes.  2 different FBI memos referencing George Bush. One of them regarding Bush being involved with the anti-Castro Cubans surrounding the BOP and the Kennedy assassination, and the other one placing Bush Sr. in TX on that day.\n\n### Was there only one shooter?\n\nYes. The official story says 1 shooter.

She posted pics on social media.\n\n### Were they going to form a group?\n\nYes\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n-Some think they were going to pull a 9/11 there.\n-Witnesses eliminated that would not corroborate the narrative put out by the media\n-You can't have too many credible, normie people contradicting the official account or other normies get suspicious and distrustful. It negates the op (public belief is a part of the op).\n\n### How did they die?\n\nCar crash, shot, died in their sleep, hit and run\n\n### What CIA report was released by WK?\n\nThe report showing how CIA can use cars to assassinate people.

What hotel did the 'reported' gunfire occur from. What floors specifically? Someone owns those top floors. Paddock was worth $2 million. Identify the spook. Historical data collection reveals something. There was an eye witness. He wasn't registered as a security guard. MS-13 is important. It doesn't add up. There wasn't only one shooter. What do the new JFK files infer? There wasn't only one shooter.\n\nSomeone was in Las Vegas during this time. What was the real mission? Survivors dying randomly. These survivors have something in common. They talked on social media. Were they going to form a group. How do they die? What CIA report was released by Wikileaks? You can control a car. The survivors died in a car crash.\n\nThis connects to Saudi Arabia. It just happened in Saudi Arabia. Was POTUS in Las Vegas that night? Someone had a classified meeting.

Someone was Obama's mentor. Alwaleed and Hillary are connected. Someone was Hillary's mentor. Alwaleed and Bush Sr./Jr. are connected. We entered into a war post 9-11.

FOIA docs are being publicly released. Important information is contained within these c-releases. Christopher Wray is important with regards to these releases. Money laundering. War generates many nation states to payout billions. Someone audits where the money goes. $15,000 for a toothbrush? We attacked Iraq. Halliburton. They specialize in oil field services. 'Senior' level political officials are affiliated with Halliburton. Look at the primary goal. Look at the primary mode of influence that drives corruption. The money buys something. This is connected to Saudi Arabia and Alwaleed. This is connected to Las Vegas.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### Why was the arrest of Alwaleed and others important?\n\n### How is Alwaleed and BO tied to HUMA?\n\n>Western universities[edit]\nIn 2005, al-Waleed gave Georgetown University the second-largest donation in history to create the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU) in the university's School of Foreign Service. On 8 May 2008, al-Waleed gave £16 million to Edinburgh University to fund a \"centre for the study of Islam in the contemporary world.\"[59] He has also endowed the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Center for American Studies and Research (CASAR).[60] The Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medical College is named for al-Waleed.[61] The Centre of Islamic Studies at the University of Cambridge also bears the name of Al-Waleed,[62] and the Islamic Studies Program at Harvard University are also named for him.\n\n### Why did Alwaleed finance BO pre-political days?\n\n### Why did Alwaleed finance BO pre-political days?\n\n### What is HUMA? Define.\n\n### What book was BO caught reading?\n\n### Why was this immediately disregarded as false?\n\nHe's supposed to be a \"Christian\"\n\n### What is ‘Post-American World by Fareed Zakaria’?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### Why would the President of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA be reading this book?\n\n### What church did BO attend as pre-POTUS?\n\nThe church's early history coincided with the American civil rights movement, subsequent murder of Martin Luther King Jr., and the tumultuous period that engulfed the civil rights movement after King's death due to intense competition among actors over who would carry King's mantle. During that tumultuous period, an influx of radical black Muslim groups had begun to headquarter in Chicago, and Trinity sought to recontextualize Christianity through black theology in order to counter the influence of radical black Muslim leaders, who taught that it was impossible to be both black and Christian. (WIKIPEDIA)\n\n### Who was BO’s mentor?\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski, was a teacher of BO at Columbia and recruited him into Business International Corporation, a CIA front company\n\n### How is Alwaleed and HRC connected?\n\nThrough mutual CFR friend Sandy Weill who repealed the Glass-Steagall Act. Citigroup raised $12.5 billion in convertible preferred stock in a private placement with Talal, after private meetings with the Federal Reserve. With a market cap of $20.5 billion on Friday, November 21, 2008, the U.S. taxpayer effectively owned this compan. Our government's bailout program was in the hands of his crony New York Fed, where Sandy Weill had served as a Director from 2001 through 2006, and the U.S. Treasury Department, run at that point by Hank Paulson, formed CEO of Goldman Sachs. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and New York Fed President Timothy Geithner held a conference call with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, and Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan (a former bank lobbyist) to discuss Citigroup. Sanford Weill is the pen Council on Foreign Relations member Bill Clinton used to sign the REPEAL of FDR's Banking Act. Later, Clinton Foundation hired Kevin Thurm as its executive vice president.

He founded the Saudi Binladin Group (Saudi Binladin Group), a construction company that made him and his family a fortune by virtue of his relationship with Faisal of Saudi Arabia. Faisal reigned as monarch until his death in 1975, and granted Bin Laden's company exclusive rights to all construction projects undertaken by the Saudi Arabian government.  \nSOURCE: https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-connection-between-Osama-bin-Laden-Saudi-Royal-Family-Bush-family-9-11\n\n### Who in SA is connected specifically to the Bin Laden family?\n\nFaisal of Saudi Arabia (King)\n\n### What did they deliver?\n\nOsama bin Laden\n\n### To who?\n\n### Why?\n\nProtection\n\n### What does money buy?\n\nPolitical influence and control. Silence, protection\n\n### Why are the events in SA relevant to the above?\n\nWealthy Saudis (including some royals) essentially bought political influence directly and through the media.\n\n### Who is the financial backer for human trafficking?\n\nSome wealthy Saudis\n\n### Who is the ‘broker’ for underage sex?\n\nThose who make deals with the family to buy the girl for Islamic marriage (temporary, just for sex), also kidnapping or luring minors away\n\nImams are typically involved to get a cut for doing the \"marriage\".  This is generally how muslim men justify prostitution. Big problem in India. These temp marriages can last ffor up to 2 months.\n\n### Think SA.\n\n---\n\n### How does FB & Instagram play a role in capture?\n\n- Broadcasts location. \n- Virtual meat-market of unwitting subjects/slaves. \n- Gullible people telegraph to the world their personal details.\n- Insta Models advertise escort services\n\n### Think ‘Taken’.\n\nMovie in which young white American girl is nabbed in Paris, and put on drugs (opiods) to sell in an auction, involving wealthy Arabs, without her consent obviously.\n\n### Fantasy right?\n\nIt may seem like this situation is only a sick fantasy but it is correct and true.\n\n### Why do select senior political officials have foundations/institutes?\n\nThis is how they can receive millions in bribes without raising suspicion or violating US law. \n- This is how senior US Congressmen/women can and do amass vast wealth (tens or hundreds of millions) on a salary of less than $200k/year. or \n-  as McCain Foundation has a division for trafficking, it also has a division for 'rescue' allowing them to be able to dispose of noncompliant within their own organization, legally and where they appear heros. Example: Ashton Kucher, employed by McCain Foundation. \n- Also, likely the foundation has another arm of legal services. All in house, all secure.\n\n### What is money laundering?\n\nPushing money from illegal operations into the system for legal use\n\n### What does money buy?\n\nControl over governments. Favors, political power, access, information, tech., people (sex slavery and politicians)\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nBad actors in KSA who own politicians  & media here have used bribery to gain influence, used social media to shape narrative and hunt victims for human trafficking/sex slavery (including children).\n\n### What other people were arrested in SA?\n\nPolice, military officers, i.e. protection force\n\nFahd bin Abdullah- former Deputy Defence Minister; \nTurki bin Nasser- former head of the Meteorology Enviorment\nTurki bin Abdullah- former Governer of Riyadh\nMiteb bin Abdullah- former Minister of the National Guard\nAdel Fakeih- former Economy and Planning Minister\nAbdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan- former Royal Saudi Navy Commander\nIbrahim Abdulaziz Al-Assaf- former finance minister\nKhaled al-Tuwaijri- former head of royal court\nMohammad al-Tobaishi- former head of protocol at the Royal Court\nAbdulrahman Fakieh- businessman\nAmr Al-Dabbagh, businessman- CEO of Al-Dabbagh Group (ADG)\nBakr bin Laden- chairman of the Saudi Binladin Group and half-brother of Osama bin Laden.\nKhalid Abdullah Almolhem- former head of Saudi Arabian Airlines\nLoai Nasser- prominent businessman\nMansour al-Balawi, prominent businessman\nMohammed Hussein Al Amoudi, billionaire businessman\nNasser Al Tayyar- businessman, non-executive board member Al Tayyar Travel Group\nSaleh Abdullah Kamel- billionaire businessman, owner of Arab Radio and Television Network and founder of the Dallah al Baraka Group\nSaoud al-Daweesh- former chief executive of Saudi Telecom Company\nWaleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim- billionaire businessman, brother-in-law of King Fahd, Chairman of Middle East Broadcasting Company (MBC)\nZuhair Fayez- prominent businessman\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/saudi-ministers-national-guard-economy-dismissed-171104190619900.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Saudi_Arabian_purge#Detained\n\n### What are their backgrounds?\n\nMEDIA, finance, foreign affairs (ceremonies etc.)\n\n### Are any connected to the Podesta Group?\n\nYes: Several of Top Saudi Officials Arrested Over Weekend Are Linked to Podesta Group\nhttp://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/11/several-top-saudi-officials-arrested-weekend-linked-podesta-group/\nhttps://archive.is/XckjC\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nTony Podesta, his Podesta Group, and by extension, his brother John Podesta are under investigation for FARA violations as well as money laundering.  Both brothers are heavy hitters in DC and intimately linked to Democrat party, the Clintons andObama.\n\n### What do you need in order to prosecute senior political officials?\n\nIrrefutable evidence, a trail that is verifiable (not hearsay or such). Their network is important and forms a big web. Info gleaned from one suspect that can be verified absolutely. Paper trail.\n\n### How do you avoid public misconception?\n\n- DIRECT COMMUNICATION, evidence, transparency.\n- Bypass the Narrative setters, expose those who have kept people in the dark in order to cover up.\n- Demonstrate how they have misrepresented themselves. \n- Leak the story beforehand\n\n### How do you justify counter-political attacks to the mass public?\n\nNational Security, connect them with the most vile & indefensible thing there is: child sex abuse/exploitation\nIT HAS TO BE TRUE THOUGH\n\n### Why is information so vital?\n\nJustify why accused aren't being politically persecuted but are genuinely bad actors, and have acted against the country itself, not just trivial corruption, personal foibles.\n\n### Is the country divided?\n\nDivide & conquer, decades of indoctrination via cultural Marxism to fulfill an agenda, resulting in two distinct world experiences and therefore world views.\n\n### Why does the MSM portray the country as being divided?\n\n- Control, to help along the fracturing of the nation.\n- Distraction from perpetrators in Gov, Media, Corps. Destabilization\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nMedia, many beholden to KSA bad actors will attempt to present a narrative that any prosecutions of US polticians/businesspersons are the result of a vicious, political persecution program, Trump is \"literally Hitler\" and exploit real and manufactured divisions with the US populace in order to minimize the damage to the accused bad actors.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nOne family was permitted to leave immediately after 9-11. Someone authorized the departure. No one else was permitted to leave. It was a private plane. What can private planes carry v commercial? What airport did they arrive/depart from. Something was carried on a private plane to Iran. The Bin Laden family was here during 9-11. Someone in Saudi Arabia is connected specifically to the Bin Laden family. What did they deliver? To whom? The money buys something.\n\nThe events in Saudi Arabia are relevant to the above. Someone is the financial backer for human trafficking. Someone is the 'broker' for underage sex. Think Saudi Arabia. FB & Instagram plays a role in the capture. Think 'Taken'. Fantasy, right? Select senior political officials have foundations/institutes for a reason. Look at money laundering. The money buys something. Other people were arrested in Saudi Arabia. Look at their backgrounds. They are connected to the Podesta Group. You need something in order to prosecute senior political officials. You must avoid public misconception. You must justify counter-political attacks to the mass public. information is so vital. The MSM portray the country as being divided.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### What family was permitted to leave immediately after 9-11?\n\n### Who authorized the departure?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### Was anyone else permitted to leave?\n\n### Repeat.\n\n### Was anyone else permitted to leave?\n\n(Tampa, of course, is home to General Tommy Franks and the Pentagon's Central Command (CentCom), which now rules Afghanistan and Iraq directly, and indirectly rules the entire oil-rich Middle East and Central Asia through its growing network of Halliburton-supplied military bases. Raytheon, of course, is the massive arms manufacturer that supplied many of the high-tech weapons used in Afghanistan and Iraq. Tampa is also near Venice FL, where Mad Cow Morning News has exposed numerous secrets about the training of 9-11 pilots Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi at shadowy local flight schools. And Tampa is in Florida, where Gov. Jeb Bush stole the 2000 election for his brother George, and where Jeb issued Executive Order 2001-261 to prepare the FL National Guard for a terrorist attack on 9-7-01.)\"\n\n... It seems that in spite of the fact that Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz and his government have been accused of funding charities linked to Al Qaeda, James Baker's firm still feels the need to defend the Prince against those \"evil\" trial lawyers representing the orphaned families of the 9-11 victims.\n\nBut perhaps what is just as shocking to me is the allegation that the son of this SAME Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz was reportedly flown out of the United States\n\n... But then the jet flew to New Orleans \"to pick up someone who needed a ride to New York.\" So this plane made AT LEAST 5 flights on 9-13, but the FAA told the Tampa Tribune, \"it's not in our logs... it didn't occur.\" \n\nFrom: http://archive.democrats.com/view.cfm?id=14289\n\n### Was it a private plane?\n\n### What can private planes carry v commercial?\n\nAll sorts of stuff not allowed on commercial flights http://www.pjsgroup.com/why-travel-with-us/carry-on-regulations/\n\n### What airport did they arrive/depart from?\n\nFt. Lauderdale to Tampa, Raytheon hangar at Tampa Int'l airport, then to New Orleans, LA.\n\n### What was carried on a private plane to Iran?\n\n[SPECULATION] Cash, guns, anything... people without passports/fugitives, etc.\n\n### Why was the Bin Laden family here during 9-11?\n\nMost of Mr. bin Laden's relatives were attending high school and college. They are among the 4,000 Saudi students in the United States. King Fahd, the ailing Saudi ruler, sent an urgent message to his embassy here saying there were \"bin Laden children all over America\" and ordered, \"Take measures to protect the innocents,\" the ambassador said.  From NYT via https://www.wanttoknow.info/010930nytimes\n\n### Coincidence?\n\n### How does SA connect to the Bin Laden family?\n\n### Who in SA is connected specifically to the Bin Laden family?\n\nMohammed bin Laden (father), largest construction co in SA, became a conglomerate distributing consumer goods across the ME. http://www.history.com/topics/osama-bin-laden\nSheik Kalid Bin Mafouz's Sister was Osama's Wife.\n\n### What did they deliver?\n\n### To who?\n\n### Why?\n\n### What does money buy?\n\n### Why are the events in SA relevant to the above?\n\nThose involved in 9/11 being rounded up\n\n### Who is the financial backer for human trafficking?\n\nThe House of Saud / royals?\n http://www.gvnet.com/humantrafficking/SaudiArabia.htm\n\n### Who is the ‘broker’ for underage sex?\n\n### Think SA.\n\n### How does FB & Instagram play a role in capture?\n\nSearch TagYourSponsor\n\nIts really easy to lure kids and even adults on any social media, making them \"soft targets\" for kidnappers.\n\nLocation services.\n\n### Think ‘Taken’.\n\n### Fantasy right?\n\nTweens, girls, adult women and even boys exposing themselves willingly online to the world. They are unaware that they are putting themselves onto the global markeplace a la 'Taken'\n\n### Why do select senior political officials have foundations/institutes?\n\n### What is money laundering?\n\nMeasures to turn ill gotten gains into apparently legitimate gains\n\n### What does money buy?\n\nAnything one could want - almost\nA new identity.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### What other people were arrested in SA?\n\n### What are their backgrounds?\n\n### Are any connected to the Podesta Group?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nPodesta Group legitimized their (Saudi bad actors') US operations, and therefore are accomplices. They facilitated, coordinated, directed the actions in the US.\n\n### What do you need in order to prosecute senior political officials?\n\nA functioning DOJ, FBI and an non interfering CIA.....  A lot of irrefutable evidence and some public opinion on your side.\n\n### How do you avoid public misconception?\n\nCredible evidence\n\n### How do you justify counter-political attacks to the mass public?\n\n### Why is information so vital?\n\nWithout the information, we cannot know the real story and thus we may not realize if we are misplacing our loyalty (ex. Antifa - they think they're fighting fascists but they ARE the fascists).\n\n### Is the country divided?\n\nOnline but not so much in person. Ideologically separated by media & perceptions, echo chambers. Day-to-day not much conflict among normal citizens. Only when you compare the usual liberal hotspots to the rest of the (less-vocal) population. The MSM makes the liberal presence seem far more powerful than it currently is.\n\n### Why does the MSM portray the country as being divided?\n\nDestabilization with the objective of creating chaos and panic, following which citizens will be more open to further loss of freedoms in the name of 'safety'.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nIt creates a false reality for people still reliant on Mockingbird media. Then the cabal can choose to exceed even that 'reality' and the public will only be mildly surprised due to the false foundation.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

It is littered throughout court documents going back to (?) a divorce case in Arizona, where Arpaio got word of it first and presumably tipped off Trump long before Rogers.  This person was an FBI informant as well but all his information was surpressed.  There is a long trail of his existence and claims.  The NYT tried to smear him via CIA quotes that he was a they years back but then they turned around and hired him again, apparently mad skillz.

The NSA is limited regarding the ability to capture and unmask US persons. Someone sets the narrative. US citizens. Someone either can or cannot violate this rule.

Fantasy land.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### Why, by coincidence, is there a terrorist attack (or mental health c-level attack) within a short time post negative D news?\n\n### Do you believe in coincidences?\n\nWhen you have zero intel (intelligence data), everything looks a coincidence. When you have all the intel, you can see which event is directly connected to which event.  Things are no longer a coincidence.\n\n### They think you are stupid. Puppets w/o power. They want your guns. Why? No power left.\n\n### Who funds ISIS?\n\n### What email published by WL connects SA/Qatar to ISIS?\n\n### Was HRC connected?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### Why is controlling the narrative important?\n\n### Do most people investigate for themselves or simply follow?\n\n### Why is the MSM so hostile towards POTUS?\n\n### Who controls the MSM?\n\n### Why, each and every day, is the MSM pushing a particular topic?\n\nExample: Texas church shooting following the paradise papers leak.\n\n### Coordinated?\n\n### Who sets the narrative for the day?\n\n### How is the narrative communicated to the MSM?\n\n### What does the NSA/MI have (at least what you know of) that allows for data collection?\n\nMassive databases and servers. Particularly a huge site in Utah.\n\n### Think Snowden.\n\n### Why is the NSA limited re: ability to capture and unmask US persons?\n\nNSA is a central location for \"Five Eyes\", i.e. an unlimited intelligence sharing network between Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Placing blocks on NSA's scope prevents NSA from interfering with work conducted by other intelligence agencies in the US. The Law.\n\n### Who sets the narrative?\n\n### US persons?\n\n### Who can violate this rule?\n\nThose who have means to do so who are not constrained by rules\n\n### Who cannot violate this rule?\n\nNon law enforcement.  Sally Yates can't unmask Flynn on US soil having a conversation with the Russian ambassador also on US soil.  The surveillance would have been illegal to begin with.\n\n### Why is Adm R so important?\n\nHe tipped off Trump.   He would know if people were being illegally unmasked or illegally tapped.  All legitimately obtained taps would presumably go through his agency and all records of who requested unmasking, as well as likely records of affidavits used to obtain FISA warrants would be housed with NSA.  He would likely see shenanigans.\n\n### Who wanted him fired?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/us/politics/obama-remove-nsa-leader-michael-rogers.html\n\nJames Clapper was head of Department of Information and was pushed into resigning after denying the NSA (Roger's department) was collecting data on Americans.\n\n### Why?\n\n<< Wrong Admiral: It's Admiral Rogers /NSA who met with Trump after the election.  Obama wanted him fired: \n\nAshton is a nuclear physicist who was sec of defense under Obama, and assistant sec of defense under Clitnton with no military background.\n\n### Why wasn’t Adm R replaced by POTUS when taking office?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### Who has the ultimate power to designate classification?\n\n### Who ultimately sets classification?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### Fantasy land.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

SA's reserves are drying up; their GDP% is in decline; Deficit % of GDP is -19.5% in 2015 (down from +12 in 2012); Salman might be desperate enough to reach out to Muslim Brotherhood - but Salman proposed an offer to open up Saudi for American investments \"in the tune of an absurd $2 trillion over coming year\"\nLink to that email: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39143\n\n### What US assets are in place in/near SA?\n\nQatar hosts the largest US military presence in the region.\nSource:\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/05/middleeast/qatar-us-largest-base-in-mideast/index.html\n\n### What assurances were made to protect the Kingdom?\n\nSaudi Arabia is one of America’s largest foreign creditors to the tune of ~$120 billion which stems back to a deal between Nixon and King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud made in 1974 which the King demanded remain secret. The U.S. would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment. In return, the Saudis would plow petrodollar revenue back into U.S. Treasuries.  Saudi Arabia also agreed that the U.S. dollar would be used in all oil trade.  This increased demand.\n\n### Who shot down the missile from Yemen?\n\nQ said \"we\" shot it down (i.e., the USA)\n\nAlso, on top of all the other arms contracts that SA has with the US, they just agreed to buy THAAD for 15 billion. \n\n- https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-missiles/u-s-approves-possible-15-billion-sale-of-thaad-missiles-to-saudi-arabia-idUSKBN1CB2IN\n\n### POTUS declassify_speech_Jap_11_5\n\nPOTUS speech on Texas shooting: cadence off, abnormal pauses at various points.

(MS13)(Votes)(187)\n\n### Why is open border important?\n\n- To allow the illegals into the US\n- Can't import massive numbers of third-worlders legitimately/legally without popular revolt. \n- Open borders ensures that there is NO vetting whatsoever of who gets in, no tracking, no ability to control the state of the nation and its direction. \n- It also allows for new D “voters” and more voter fraud, pushes down wages and alienates the (founding stock) public ever more from govt – lowering confidence in govt and society with withdrawal from the social space allows foreigners to take more control of culture and exert more influence.\n\n### What did BO say on the campaign trail last year to illegals within the US?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-WX5S0-Pbk\n\n-He stated that the voter rolls and the citizenship rolls are not cross checked. Essentially giving the wink and nod for illegals to go ahead and vote - that no one will check up on it.\n\n### What did BO encourage?\n\n### Was this illegal?\n\n### Who owns sizeable stakes in voter machine co’s?\n\n### Who decides what voter machines are used in elections?\n\nState level  / 2.

This map will tell you about whats going to happen.\n\n### What is a sequence?\n\nIt's a set with order to the elements\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nA sequence can have a pattern.\n\n### When does a map become a guide?\n\n- When you're in one set and need to be in another\n- Maps become guides when they lead one to a destination\n- When you are lost or confused about where you are.\n- When it's understood, and when the path to the destination is clear. \n- When you understand the symbols\n- A set of steps to follow to achieve objective.\n\n### What is a keystone?\n\n1- A keystone is the wedge-shaped stone piece at the apex of a masonry arch\n2- Something on which associated things depend for support\n\n### \"Everything stated is relevant. \nEverything.\nFuture provides past. \nMap provides picture.\nPicture provides 40,000ft. v.\n40,000ft. v. is classified.\"\n\nAll Q's statements and questions are relevant, even if it does not appear to be at the time it was asked.\n\nFuture provides the past alludes to the instruction regarding mirror - please utilize the infographic linked on how to read Q's posts for help in interpreting the method of reveal he uses.\n\nMap provides the picture alludes to the statement(s) regarding what a map is, legend explains the map and the use of the map. Simply put, all of the questions & statements thus far should help paint a large picture as to the very deep and widespread corruption, evil and degeneracy amongst our elites (three families indicated by + signs).\n\n40,000 vertical feet is an expression denoting a high view, an overview\n- is also the cruising altitude of a commercial plane\n\nThe Picture provides 40,000ft v means that the large picture is the overview, not bogged down or cluttered with details and minutae.\n\n40,000ft. v. is classified. = The true extent of this large picture is classified.\n\n### Why is a map useful?\n\nTo locate a place, person or thing in a place; distances between, movement of people/group/things\n\n### \"Think direction.\nThink full picture\"\n\nTrump's Asia trip: 1) Hawaii, 2) Japan, 3) South Korea, 4) China, 5) Vietnam, 6) Philippines.\n\n### Who controls the narrative?\n\nFake media and their owners\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nThey control who they let into these organizations and therefore are very very careful to only let in their own, keeping the highest positions for themselves while hiring regular everyday Joe's for more menial roles so they don't look too suspicious. After all nepotism is obvious and why so many elites change their name when they live very public lives. Who would want to get their news from a Rothschild?\n\n### What is a spell?\n\nA spiritual/magical tool; a command to make something happen or to gain control over someone, suppression of willpower. \n(Chemical spell = scopolamine.

Pray, sinful one.\n\n### Why was this necessary?\n\n### What questions were asked re: SA prior to SA events?\n\nhttps://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/September_11,_2001:_Evacuation_of_Saudi_Nationals\n\nOn the afternoon of September 13, 2001, \"three Saudi men in their early 20s flew in a Lear jet from Tampa, Fla., to Lexington, Ky., where they boarded a Boeing 747 with Arabic writing on it waiting to take them out of the country.\"\n\nWhiteHouse authorized it\n\nTampa Florida airport\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nCurrent events in KSA mirror previous events in the US. Specifically, the coup in KSA mirrors/reflects the coup in US on 9/11. This time the winners/losers are reversed. 9/11 - KSA won, US lost. Today - KSA lost, US won. The US let one airplane fly from Florida (Bush stronghold) to Las Vegas (Alwaleed property owned there: Mandalay Bay upper floors). This plane was carrying someone back to KSA.\n\n### \"Think mirror.\nLook there, or [here], or there, truth is behind you.\"\n\nIn a mirror the reflection is reversed.\nYou look forward and you can see what is behind you in a mirror. \n\nSynthetic terrorism = smoke & mirrors... You look at the \"terrorist\" in front of you but the puppet master is behind you. Look closer to the mirror or behind you and you'll see.\n\nIndictments are the past brought to the present by a trial, and the future is the live testimony. The truth in this way is literally behind you.\n\n### What is a map?\n\nA map is a set of directions to guide you from point A to point B.\n\nIt can also be maps of thought, or the diagrams requested before, to connect dots and see big picture\n\n### Why is a map useful?\n\nSo that you arrive at your destination safely and don't get lost.\n\n### What is a legend?\n\nQ used acronyms throughout his posts.\nA legend is a caption, a title or brief explanation appended to an article, illustration, cartoon, or poster. A key is an explanatory list of symbols used in a map, table, etc. Legend is more generic, while key is more specific.\n\nHRC = Alice\nWonderland = Saudi Arabia\n\n### Why is a legend useful?\n\nSignatures, + crumbs = understanding of events happening now and those that have already occurred.\n\n### What is a sequence?\n\n1. A following of one thing after another; succession.\n2. An order of succession; an arrangement.\n3. A related or continuous series.\n\nA sequence (or flow) map is pieces of information grouped together that forms a path. if a decision is made you branch on that sequence to the final outcome. see flow chart\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nQ is giving us the pieces. We have to keep them in order and follow the sequence of events. This will give insight into what might come next.\n\n### When does a map become a guide?\n\nA sequence of signs has been provided by Q in his posts and anons need to locate them in current events. Doing so will reveal the destination.\n\n### What is a keystone?\n\n### \"Everything stated is relevant. \nEverything.\nFuture provides past. \nMap provides picture.\nPicture provides 40,000ft. v.\n40,000ft. v. is classified.\"\n\n-We had a picture from 40,000 ft. view.\n-The picture provides map. Find the map either hidden in image(keystone) or otherwise. \n-Map provides a location.\n-Something hidden there?(keystone)\n-Past provides the future.\n\n### Why is a map useful?\n\n### \"Think direction.\nThink full picture\"\n\nSouth China Sea\n\n### Who controls the narrative?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### What is a spell?\n\nA spell is also sheer work of will. In magick, when one casts a spell one might draw what they want to happen, visualize it happening, call upon the collective group/coven or, in media's case gullible populace, and harness all that energy and directly channel it to get the desired results. But remember, be careful what you wish for...\n\n### Who is asleep?\n\nNot only are they \"asleep\" but while in that sleep they are easily manipulated to be the perpetuators of the spell casters message, participants in events and thoughts that help accomplish the objective of the spell.\n\n### Dissemination.\n\n### Attention on deck.\n\nAttention on deck: get ready, analyze the media, find the hidden spin, feel the low energy; pay attention and keep finding answers relevant questions, draw connections between real world events.\n\n### There is an active war on your mind.\n\nFrom PSYOP to MINDWAR Written by General Aquino (founder of the Temple of Set, an offshoot of the Church of Satan) and General Paul Vallely (who called for an American Spring march on Washington a few years back) \nhttp://ce399.typepad.com/weblog/files/MindWar.pdf\n\n### \"Be [p]repared.\nOpe[r]ations underway.\nOperators [a]ctive. \nGraphic is essential. \nFind the ke[y]stone.\nMoves and countermoves. \nThey never thought she would lose. \nSnow white.\nGodfather III.\nIron Eagle.\"\n\nIRON EAGLE movie series\n1.Extracting a hostage\n2.Teaming up with Russia to take out a rogue nation\n3.Taking out a drug cartel\n4.Preventing a false flag\n\nGodfather 3 is about corruption in the Vatican Bank.\n-in the opening sequence, 2nd sentence:\n\"The only wealth in this world is children, more than all the money and power on Earth.\"\n\n-The Godfather is called The Don.

SA = Cash Flow\n\nRothchild - provides a way of influence over matters of national finance (hence all the central banks). They are able to control and manipulate national finances to their favour via “legitimised avenues” such as stocks, property investments etc. While these avenues generate massive wealth they are also fairly well documented hence the need for a “cash flow” partner in SA. Rothchilds have also worked their way into some extremely influential positions to be able to manipulate things to their benefit.

Above all, China might be financially secure presently, but even they knew and know it was predicated on receiving something with value, and sustained inflation of the dollar would render collection null and void.\n\n### Why is Russia helping to kill ISIS?\n\nBecause the border with the Middle East affects them.

He is related to 20 British Dukes, the 13th cousin of Britain’s Queen Mother, and of her daughter Queen Elizabeth. He is 13th cousin once removed from Prince Charles and has direct descent from King Henry III, Charles II, and Edward I of England. “Father George and wife Barbara [Bush] are both descendants of Godfroi de Bouillon who, in 1099, led European noblemen in the successful Crusade to recapture Jerusalem from the Islamic faith and moved into the King’s palace at Temple Mount … Godfroi de Bouillon was the first king of Jerusalem and the Duke of Lower Lorraine, a major region for the Illuminati bloodline\n\n### What happened during WWII?\n\nEuropean powers fought with Russia and America against Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\n### Was Hitler a puppet?\n\nIn the beginning yes. Hitler accepted money from International Bankers. He soon used that to Germany's benefit and broke from the international banking system, thereby \"cutting the strings\"\n\n### What was the purpose?\n\nTo use another form of \"socialism\" to combat international socialism (Communism of the USSR) which had gone off the plan and was no longer completely in the control of the bad actors.\n\n### What was the real purpose of the war?\n\nCreation of Israel by Rothschilds\n\n### What age was GS?\n\n### What is the Soros family history?\n\n### What has occurred since the fall of N Germany?\n\nGermany had been split into eastern and western Germany.\n\n### Who is A.

The physical appearance of each body—height, weight, age, hair and eye colour, visible birthmarks, scars or tattoos, was catalogued and any personal effects on the bodies were gathered and placed in small canvas bags corresponding to their number. (It was decided to preserve all bodies of First Class passengers because of the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates)\n\n### When were tickets purchased for her maiden voyage?\n\n1. In July of 1911, White Star and Harland & Wolff announced a date for Titanic's maiden voyage - March 20, 1912. \n\nSeptember 20, 1911: Titanic's maiden voyage delayed due to necessary diversion of workers and materials to repair Olympic. \n\nOctober 11, 1911: White Star officially announces new date for Titanic's maiden voyage in the London Times - April 10, 1912. \n\nThis information leads me to believe that tickets would not have been sold before July, 1911 (when the first date was announced). It seems to make sense, also, that ticket sales would slow or stop when construction was interrupted; then ticket sales might pick up again after the Oct. 11, 1911, announcement of the new launch date. \n\n2. According to the second link I have given below, Joseph Laroche purchased tickets for his family in March, 1912. \n\n3. According to the third link below, one family was transferred to the Titanic when the ship they were ticketed for was cancelled. This transfer happened \"in the spring of 1912,\" which at least tells us that the Titanic was not sold out by spring. \n\n4.

He was given first class travel and it appears, wanted him to use his skills on statues outside their Newport villa.\n\nBill Müller served as secretary to a Dutch traffic inspector whose job was to inspect ships for insurance and investment firms and was an invited guest aboard the Titanic from the ship’s owners.\n\nMott was an influential evangelist and longtime YMCA official, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1946. He and a colleague were supposedly offered free passage on the Titanic by a White Star Line official interested in their work but declined and instead took the more humble liner Lapland.\n\nThe Italian inventor, wireless telegraphy pioneer and winner of the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics was offered free passage on Titanic but had taken the Lusitania three days earlier.\n\n### Less than 10.\n\nAlfred Gwynne Vanderbilt I also, Someone in their family objected to their sailing aboard the new ship, “because so many things can go wrong on a maiden voyage.”\n\n### What is the FED?\n\nConsortium of private central banks in the US.\n\n### What does the FED control?\n\nUS monetary policy, including interest rates.\n\n### Who controls the FED?\n\nRothschilds\n\n### Who approved the formation of the FED?\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\n### Why did H-wood glorify Titanic as a tragic love story?\n\nTo hide history / distract from the fact the last 3 major opponents of the FED died that night.\n\n### Who lived in the movie (what man)?\n\nThis line of questions suggest someone famous was shown to have survived in the movie but in reality died that night and his identity was stolen.\nPossible list\nJack Thayer\nWilliam Ernest Carter\nGeorge Dunton Widener\nHarry Elkins Widener\nJ.

Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject’s ability to think critically or independently, to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into the subject’s mind, as well as to change their attitudes, values, and beliefs.\n\n### What is a PSYOP?\n\nPsychological operations (PSYOP) are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to audiences to influence their emotions, motives, and objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.\n\n### What happened to the Hindenburg?\n\nOfficial story: exploded because of a spark and being full of hydrogen (explosive) rather than helium (inert)\n\n### What really happened to the Hindenburg?\n\nJoseph Spah was a suspected saboteur of the Hindenburg according to FBI docs:\nhttps://www.rt.com/viral/387447-hindenburg-disaster-theories-anniversary/\n\n### Who died during the ‘accident’?\n\nMost were German Nazis.

The \"Mockingbird Media\" ate it up, and then all that was left was to wait for a) a presidency without ties to the cabal and b) to let the CIA become dependent on them.\n\n### Was Snowden truly acting on his own?\n\nNo.\n\n### Nothing is as it appears.\n\nIt never is.\n\n### What show is being put on by AG Sessions since his confirmation?\n\nThat of a meek and ineffectual AG.\n\n### What show is being put on by POTUS since AG Sessions’ confirmation?\n\nDisappointment with Sessions' performance.\n\n### Why was AG Sessions’ confirmation challenged heavily?\n\nWas perceived as a major threat due to being a man of honor, therefore not in control of bad actors.\n\n### Why was RR’s confirmation smooth and easy?\n\nBecause \"Rosenstein will be in charge of overseeing the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election\" and D's believe he will side with them.\n\nhttp://thehill.com/homenews/senate/330538-senate-votes-to-confirm-rosenstein-as-deputy-attorney-general\n\n6 Opposed:\nBlumenthal (D-CT)\nBooker (D-NJ)\nCortez Masto (D-NV)\nGillibrand (D-NY)\nHarris (D-CA)\nWarren (D-MA)\n\n### What was the vote count for RR?\n\n94-6 http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/330538-senate-votes-to-confirm-rosenstein-as-deputy-attorney-general\n\n### Why did Sessions recuse himself?\n\nThey knew of their “Special Counsel” plan all along, and played into it once Mueller accepted Godfather III. Recusal did leave RR in charge of Russia special counsel “choice” to retain false sense of security in the FBI. Sessions keeps his credibility and partisan cover during ‘The Storm.’\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nAppearances (cf Mueller hiring democrat lawyers)\n\n### What group has vocally supported RM repeatedly?\n\nDemocrats and \"neo-conservatives\"\n\n### How do you capture a very dangerous animal?\n\nSubterfuge, baited trap\n\n### Who is best to conduct the attack?\n\nAn unseen enemy.\n\n### What is the one force necessary to retain control?\n\nUS military.\n\n### Why does the US Military play such a vital role in this global game of RISK?\n\nMI has most secure communications channels that are not exposed to Clowns exploits.\n\n### What is money without power?\n\nNothing\n\n### Why did POTUS depart Manila 30 min ahead of schedule?\n\nThere was some need to get back fast. Sense of urgency in his tweet:\nhttps://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/930607552378949632\n\n### Why is AF1 landing in Hawaii?\n\nIntelligence from face to face meeting in NK needs to be securely delivered to MI, not over channels that could be intercepted by ClA and other bad actors.\n-A large NSA building is located in Hawaii \nhttps://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-centers/hawaii/\n\n### Does AF1 have in-air refueling ability?\n\nAF1 is the name of ANY airplane with POTUS onboard.\n\n### Nothing is as it appears.\n\nIt never is.\n\n### What is the nickname for DC?\n\nThe Swamp, the District of Criminals\n\n### What was the DC vote breakdown between Trump & Clinton?\n\n91% Clinton\n4% Trump\n\n### Why would sealed indictments be outside of DC jurisdiction?\n\nCongress can overturn indictments within D.C.\n\n### What purpose would this serve?\n\nDispersal of cases, eliminating backlog in DC court, also persons being charged in their home districts to hammer home to their local public the extent of corruption and keep it in the public's mind and eyes.\n\n### Why are judicial appointments being rapidly completed?\n\nPreparation for large number of criminal indictments ahead.\n\n### Who can you trust?\n\n### Have faith, Patriots.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nIf you must capture a very dangerous animal, you don't attack it from the front and walk through the front door. You don't signal ahead of time you will be attacking.\n\nYou must distinguish between good and bad. You must trust who keeps secrets. You must prevent leaks. Trust someone to complete the mission. You must prevent warnings from being sent. Adm Rogers (Dir., NSA) is so important. The source code to former NSA collection p's publicly released. You must blind the CIA.What was Snowden's real primary mission? Snowden was not acting on his own.\n\nA show is being put on by AG Sessions since his confirmation. A show is being put on by POTUS since AG Sessions' confirmation. AG Sessions' confirmation was challenged heavily, yet Rod Rosenstein's confirmation smooth and easy. What was the vote count for Rod Rosenstein? Sessions recused himself. A group has vocally supported Rober Mueller repeatedly.\n\nIf we must capture a very dangerous animal, who is best to conduct the attack? Look at the one force necessary to retain control - the US Military. They play such a vital role in this global game of RISK. POTUS departed Manila 30 min ahead of schedule. Air Force 1 is landing in Hawaii. Air Force 1 has in-air refueling ability. Nothing is as it appears. Look at the nickname for DC. What was the DC vote breakdown between Trump & Clinton? Sealed indictments are outside of DC jurisdiction. This is on purpose. Judicial appointments are being rapidly completed. Have faith, Patriots.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### How do you capture a very dangerous animal?\n\n- Bait and trap. It comes to something it wants.\n- Large amounts of misdirection and surprise.\n\n### Do you attack it from the front?\n\n### Do you walk through the front door?\n\nReferring to warrant, regular judiciary actions.\n\n### Do you signal ahead of time you will be attacking?\n\n### How do you distinguish between good and bad?\n\nFeign vulnerability, see if they attack.\n\n### Who do you trust to keep secrets?\n\nIn the mind of a bad actor, dead people are the best at keeping secrets.\n\n### How do you prevent leaks?\n\nFlush out leakers with false information. Expose leakers and purge them.\n\n### Who do you trust to complete the mission?\n\n### How do you prevent warnings being sent?\n\nUse encryption\n\n### Why is Adm R. so important?\n\n### Why was the source code to former NSA collection p’s publicly released?\n\n### How do you blind the Clowns In America?\n\nForward to 2017 and (Wikileaks) Vaults 7 & 8. Now everyone is patching up their systems, and closing the blinds and doors to the CIA, and ONLY THE CIA.\n\n### What was Snowden’s primary mission?\n\n### What was Snowden’s real primary mission?\n\nPossibly feeding Wikileaks for the Vault 7 & Vault 8 leaks, because then it would tie in completely as a covert op.\n\n### Was Snowden truly acting on his own?\n\n### Nothing is as it appears.\n\n### What show is being put on by AG Sessions since his confirmation?\n\n### What show is being put on by POTUS since AG Sessions’ confirmation?\n\n### Why was AG Sessions’ confirmation challenged heavily?\n\n### Why was RR’s confirmation smooth and easy?\n\n### What was the vote count for RR?\n\n### Why did Sessions recuse himself?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n### What group has vocally supported RM repeatedly?\n\n### How do you capture a very dangerous animal?\n\n\"All warfare is deception. Pretend inferiority and encourage the arrogance of your enemy. Hold bait to them, feign disorder to draw them in, then crush them.\" Sun Tzu\n\n### Who is best to conduct the attack?\n\nAnother animal like them. A member of their herd....a Judas goat! The one they least suspect.\n\n### What is the one force necessary to retain control?\n\nFEAR. If Clowns use their power to stoke false fear, and manipulate how the general public perceives that false risk, they have Power. Show that their fears are false and they have no power.\n\n### Why does the US Military play such a vital role in this global game of RISK?\n\n-Most powerful military in the world with global force projection.\n-Advanced technology and weapons system, some not yet made public. We have bases all over the world.\n\n### What is money without power?\n\nPaper with which to buy luxury goods.\n\n### Why did POTUS depart Manila 30 min ahead of schedule?\n\n### Why is AF1 landing in Hawaii?\n\nHome to United States Pacific Command and Fleet.\n\n### Does AF1 have in-air refueling ability?\n\n### Nothing is as it appears.\n\n### What is the nickname for DC?\n\n### What was the DC vote breakdown between Trump & Clinton?\n\n### Why would sealed indictments be outside of DC jurisdiction?\n\n-DC jurisdiction too deeply involved in the Swamp\n-Jury and judge selection will greatly vary.  Allows for greater ease of attack, from all sides.  Greatly increases complexity of defense in law if a target is legally pressed from every direction.\n\n### What purpose would this serve?\n\n-Prevent Congress from overturning any of the indictments\n-Remove the litigation from the corrupt DC judges.  Decentralizing removes the ability to easily control.\n-To prevent bad DC elements from manipulating and/or leaking info.\n\n### Why are judicial appointments being rapidly completed?\n\nSo Trump's nominees are seated Federal Judges when these indictments come down and the cases are litigated.  This increases our chances of having a non-corrupt Federal Judge preside over these criminal cases.\n\n### Who can you trust?\n\n### Have faith, Patriots.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n"

A message had been directed at Lynn de Rothschild \"We're watching you and your family and distress calls will do you no good. We can hear you breathing.\" Some bad actors, possibly the CIA on behalf of the Rothschild family countered the operation. Anons have been given clues about what was going to happen beforehand. We have to learn to interpret Q's statements and questions correctly in order to understand what is being conveyed and be able to correctly build the bigger picture. Either there were posts missing from the graphic compilation (Q-Map) or anons have been missing the critical connections between items. The Q-Map is absolutely key to understanding.

Their Goddess Arianrhod shapeshifts into a large Owl, and through the great Owl-eyes, sees even into the darkness of the human subconscious and soul.\n- The Owl has a dual symbolism of wisdom and darkness, the latter meaning evil and death\n\n\nOWL = Dark OPS (Intel Comm), \nDark Arts (Occult)"

The public is not symbol literacy and therefore when the symbols are seen they are not understood, so there is no risk to displaying them openly.\n- It is a method of signaling to others that they are part of an in-group and should be greeted and treated accordingly.\n\n### Their need for symbolism will be their downfall.\n\nWearing or openly displaying their symbols not only identifies them to \"friendly\" others (members within the network or of a particular cult) but it likewise identifies them to our Patriots and allies who are working to clean out the corruption and filth of this network of bad actors worldwide.\n\n### MSM role?\n\nThe MSM's role is to label \"truth\" a conspiracy theory.blind the people and make this type of 'entertainment' normal, therefore providing power to the ones 'holding the ritual'\n\n### Push conspiracy theory.\n\nThe 'conspiracy theory' label is used to marginalize alternative viewpoints and anyone who researches and finds information on topics that are dangerous or threatening to this network of bad actors and cult members.\n\n### Social media role?\n\nTo enforce conformity of thought and attitude, world-view in culture. It elevates some persons and showcases (promotes) certain ideas and ideals, while hiding, suppressing and censoring anything counter to that approved worldview (in accord with the agenda of the cabal and their network of bad actors).\n\nSocial media role is to \"not trend\" or delete anything that is not sanctioned and is therefore labeled a conspiracy theory, thereby suppressing the truth.\n\n### Push conspiracy theory and institute new rules allowing for ban.\n\nThe conspiracy theory pushed by social media companies is that there is a nefarious plot by \"far-right\" elements to oppress and degrade minorities, therefore anyone who does not wholeheartedly believe in and support enforced diversity and multiculturalism is an evil person who is a \"Nazi\" or sympathizer. This allows them to paint broad swaths of people with a brush and enact policies to silence any dissent from the accepted (promoted) view. The new censorship rules will allow monitoring (surveillance) not only off-site but also offline for behavior that is not in conformity with their Terms of Service and they will ban a large amount of users to enforce the echo-chamber they have created.\n\nAny views or news labeled \"Conspiracy theory\" is manually prevented by companies from \"Trending\". Hence this news and information is being censored (Google, Twitter, and Facebook examples). With the new rules only approved news is allowed to be seen and promoted. Hence the truth will be suppressed and censored. \n\nOrwellian.\n\n### Censorship.\n\nSocial media companies now accept the EU laws on speech, and will enforce those even on users who are based or located in the United States, bypassing the US Constitutional right of Free Speech for Americans.\n\n### The graphic is key.\n\n### Re-read graphic (ex: what family did Soros replace (Y)).\n\n### Part II – How were they ‘adopted’ into the cult (as children).\n\n### What were they provided for obeying and staying silent (brainwashed)?\n\nPower, Fame, Riches, connections, celebrity\nPrimal Desires fulfilled.\n\nTheir lives, their legacy.\n\n### All that you know to be right is wrong.\n\n### The ‘cult’ runs the world.\n\nThe most powerful people in the world are members of a very, very dark and evil cult. They form a cabal and have a network of bad actors. Through domination of finance, media and industry (including education) they have enslaved the world.\n\nThis cult is active in the worst activities known: human/sex trafficking (including children), pornography -including of children and \"snuff\" films, slavery (including sex slavery), drug production and trafficking (CIA and Afghan poppy fields, that fund their beyond-black operations) and more. The reality is almost too horrible to accept.\n\n### Fantasy land.\n\nThe false view of reality portrayed by the media that the public believes in. This includes not only audio/visual media but print media as well (publishing) such as textbooks, history books and even science.\n\nPop culture reference: The Matrix reality (movie)\n\n### The world is fighting back (& destroying the cult).\n\nSome countries have created a low-key alliance to deny this cabal power and to remove them and their filth from power and take back our world.\n\nThe public, thanks to the Internet being able to bypass the Mockingbird media, are waking up at an ever increasing pace.\n\n### 20% public.\n\nOnly a small portion of this will be visible to the public.\n\n### 80% private.\n\nThe majority of the removal actions will be not visible to the public, we will never see it and never hear about it.\n\n### The world would otherwise collapse.\n\nIf all of the actions were public, mass hysteria, disbelief, economic chaos and violence would result. The destablisation would be very dangerous and other bad actors (including countries) would take advantage of this to impose their own nefarious plans and rule.\n\n### 40,000ft. v. (again) and need to decrease altitude to avoid ‘conspiracy’ label.\n\nIt's necessary to zoom out and focus on the larger picture again, instead of all the various details so that the members of the public who are discussing this and others who are awakening to this can avoid being tarred with the \"conspiracy theorist\" label and the information be dismissed out of hand.\n\nFocus on the BIG PICTURE when educating others and helping them to understand.\n\n### Was necessary.\n\nWe absolutely need them to be educated and understand, without fear of being labelled.\n\n### GODFATHER III.\n\n### For God & Country."

To establish trust in the rule of law. 80% will be taken out secretly \"black ops\", or else it would overwhelm the justice system.\n\n### The stage must be set.\n\nCertain events must occur in a particular order in order for other things to transpire.

      "markdown": "### Why are China & Russia communist S/closed?\n\nThey are closed societies specifically to protect their populace from the predation of the network of bad actors - destroying cultural traditions, promoting degeneracy, destroying families, eroding religious/philosophical foundations.\n\nIn particular, China saw how this group of bad actors attempted to rape Russia a second time when the USSR was brought down. It decided to transition away from Communism not directly to capitalism but a system that would suit them - very, very slowly so that they would be more in control of the transition itself and what it was transformed into without being raped by this group.\n\n### Can you find an owl / Y there?\n\nTRANSLATION: Can you find either the cultists who use the symbol of the owl, or a Rothschild in China and Russia?\n\nRussia is different than China in that when the USSR was brought down it was mostly subjugated again. Several puppets assisted in that effort until Putin was elected and turned it around. As such, there are those bad actors in the network who use the owl as their symbol, and it is a delicate balancing act for Putin: keep the country free and somewhat open but protect the country from these people. The Rothschild family is banned in Russia and it also has a standing arrest warrant for George Soros.\n\nChina has two factions always fighting for control through it's entire history (simplistic explanation). One faction will work with those who use the owl as their symbol against the other faction who is adamantly against all that it represents and does.\n\n### Was this to prevent evil from entering?\n\nPossibly to prevent outside influence post WW2\n\nThe three families (Saud, Rothschild and later Soros) have had enormous influence after WW2, all negative. Their programs and policies erode culture, promote degeneracy, financially enslave and destroy nations. All three families happen to be Jewish.\n\n### Was this to protect their children/people?\n\nYes\n\nReference Magnisky act. Two weeks after Obama signed the Magnitsky Act, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill that blocked adoption of Russian children by parents in the United States. Russia then also imposed sanctions on Browder and found Magnitsky posthumously guilty of crimes.  Some say this was done by Putin to stop the flow of Russian children being adopted for trafficking.\n\n### Why was BO shamed during trip to China, SA, other locations?\n\nObama was a puppet/messenger only. There is no reason to give the highest regards to a puppet/illegitimate President.\n- Obama was snubbed for trying to meddle in Chinese internal affairs. Need to look more specific.\n- Involvement in cults/pedophilia\n- Representative of the cabal of families and their network of bad actors\n\nObama was on his way out as president in 2016. He was humiliated by China, the Philipines, and Russia. Other than the climate deal, there was increasing amounts of friction between the countries. It was said that the US was looking weak and tired. They saw an opportunity to make Obama look weak. White House statement, Obama told Xi of \"America's unwavering support for upholding human rights.\" Xi told Obama in response, \"China opposes any other country interfering in its internal affairs in the name of human rights issues.\"\n\n### How was POTUS hosted?\n\nLike the new Leader of the World.\nTrump was treated with the highest level of respect possible; usually associated with royalty/ deeply honored guests.  POTUS was the first world leader to be invited to dinner at the Forbidden City (China) by Xi.  He also was given a private tour by the premier and his wife of all the major places revered in China, with historically unique honors\n\nSword dance in SA; traditionally a pre-battle ritual for warriors on the same side.\n\n### Compare.\n\nOne projected weakness not only of himself (puppet) but also his masters (puppeteers). The other projects strength, resolve a willingness to conduct relations and endeavors as equals and respect each other's sovereignty. Thus the former was snubbed and the latter was fetted.\n\n### Fantasy land.\n\nThe false reality portrayed by the Mockingbird media. The reality (and history) that the general public believes is fantasy, spun for them by others, kept in place by ownership and control of various forms of media: television, radio, movies, publishing (especially textbooks), newspapers (and websites), acting as \"gate-keepers\" to ensure conformity of view on the world.\n\nFantasyland: How America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History - Kurt Anderson - Could Q be referencing this book?\n\nCIA creates fantasy, confusion, cognitive distortions using several methods   http://whale.to/b/alexander.html"
