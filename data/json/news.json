    "description": "North Korea announced last week the death of Marshal Jo Myong Rok, a powerful figure in the North Korean armed forces, and for many years one of Kim Jong Il’s closest associates. Jo will probably be best remembered for his historic trip to Washington in October, 2000, when he became the only North Korean official to visit the White House and meet the President of the United States. In this excerpt from his book “Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis” (St. Martin’s Press, 2009), author Mike Chinoy, CNN’s former Senior Asia Correspondent and currently a Senior Fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, recounts that meeting, with its promise of a breakthrough in U.S. relations with North Korea—a promise that was never fulfilled.",

Thus, the simplest way to build a successful business is to follow Barnum's dictum and continue towards it for the life of the company, making your customers and employers happy.\nHappiness isn't easy though, so some business owners seek to hedge that success, fake happiness, or even ignore the rules of a free market altogether and take advantage of the government. They call this cronyism. And, with the need to work on yet another National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the cronies are lining up for their handouts.\nThe United States spent almost $600 billion on Defense in FY2015 – just over 3 percent of our GDP, and close to the total defense budgets of the next 15 countries combined. We are spending more on defense than 100 percent of our GDP in 1960, and more than the current GDPs of Sweden, Nigeria, Poland, Argentina, Belgium, and Norway, just to name a few.\n",

    "description": "A cylindrical rod is rotationally symmetric - after any arbitrary rotation around its axis it always looks the same. If an increasingly large force is applied to it in the longitudinal direction, however, it will eventually buckle and lose its rotational symmetry. Such processes, known as \"spontaneous symmetry breaking\", also occur in subtle ways in the microscopic quantum world, where they are responsible for a number of fundamental phenomena such as magnetism and superconductivity. A team of researchers led by ETH professor Tilman Esslinger and Senior Scientist Tobias Donner at the Institute for Quantum Electronics has now studied the consequences of spontaneous symmetry breaking in detail using a quantum simulator. The results of their research have recently been published in the scientific journal Science.",

    "description": "This is the 19th article in the the series, Declassified: Apartheid Profits. While researching the recently published book Apartheid Guns and Money: A Tale of Profit, Open Secrets collected approximately 40,000 archival documents from 25 archives in seven countries. This treasure trove contains damning details of the individuals and corporations that propped up apartheid and profited in return. Many of these documents were kept secret until now. Most remain hidden despite South Africa’s transition to democracy. OPEN SECRETS believes that it is vital to allow the public to scrutinise the primary evidence. This week we explore the close ties between the highly militarised pariah states of Israel and apartheid South Africa.",

    "headline": "High-Level Contacts Between North Korea And Iran Hint At Deeper Military Cooperation «  Breaking Energy - Energy industry news, analysis, and commentary",
    "description": " Pyongyang has emerged as a critical partner in Tehran’s ‘Axis of Resistance,’ and officials warn that their joint efforts may extend to weapons of mass destruction. High-level meetings between North Korean and Iranian officials in recent months are stoking concerns inside the U.S. government about the depth of military ties between the two American adversaries. In September, President Trump ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct a fresh review of any potential bilateral nuclear collaboration. Yet officials in Washington, Asia, and the Middle East who track the relationship indicate that Pyongyang and Tehran have already signaled a commitment to jointly develop their ballistic missile systems and other military/scientific programs. North Korea has vastly expanded its nuclear and long-range missile capabilities over the past year, developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could potentially target the western United States with nuclear warheads. Over the same period, U.S. intelligence agencies have spotted Iranian defense officials in Pyongyang, raising the specter that they might share dangerous technological advances with each other. “All of these contacts need to be better understood,” said one senior U.S. official working on the Middle East. “This will be one of our top priorities.” SUSPICIOUS MEETINGS In early August, Kim Yong-nam, North Korea’s number two political leader and head of its legislature, departed Pyongyang amid great fanfare for an extended visit to Iran. The official reason was to attend the inauguration of President Hassan Rouhani, but the length of the visit raised alarm bells in Washington and allied capitals. North Korean state media said the trip lasted four days, but Iranian state media said it was ten, and that Kim was accompanied by a large delegation of other top officials. Kim had last visited Tehran in 2012 to attend a gathering of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Cold War-era body composed of developing nations that strived to be independent of Washington and the Kremlin. Yet he skipped most of the events associated with that conference, instead focusing on signing a bilateral scientific cooperation agreement with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. According to U.S. intelligence officials, that pact looked very similar to the one Pyongyang inked with Syria in 2002; five years later, Israeli jets destroyed a building in eastern Syria that the United States and UN believe was a nearly operational North Korean-built nuclear reactor. Notably, one of the Iranian officials who attended the 2012 gathering with Kim was Atomic Energy Organization chief Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani, who was sanctioned by Washington and the UN for his alleged role in nuclear weapons development. Similarly, Kim’s latest trip focused on more than just lending support to Rouhani, according to North Korean and Iranian state media. Kim and Vice Foreign Minister Choe Hui-chol inaugurated their country’s new embassy in Tehran, a symbol of deepening ties between the two governments. They also held a string of bilateral meetings with foreign leaders, many from countries that have been significant buyers of North Korean weapons in recent decades (e.g., Zimbabwe, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Namibia). The Trump administration has been intensifying diplomatic pressure on all these countries to cut their economic and military ties with Pyongyang in response to the regime’s barrage of nuclear and missile tests this year. Regarding missile development, Iran and North Korea presented a united front against Washington during Kim’s stay. Like Pyongyang, Tehran has moved forward with a string of ballistic missile tests in recent months, despite facing UN Security Council resolutions and condemnation by the Trump administration. After meeting with Speaker of Parliament Ali Larijani on August 4, Kim declared, “Iran and North Korea share a mutual enemy [the United States]. We firmly support Iran on its stance that missile development does not need to be authorized by any nation.” COVERT CONTACTS The meetings that have gone unreported in state media are even more worrisome for allied governments. In recent years, U.S. and South Korean intelligence services have tracked a steady stream of Iranian and North Korean officials visiting each other in a bid to jointly develop their defense systems. Many of the North Koreans are from defense industries or secretive financial bodies that report directly to dictator Kim Jong-un, including Offices 39 and 99 of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. Last year, U.S. authorities reported that missile technicians from one of Iran’s most important defense companies, the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, had traveled to North Korea to help develop an eighty-ton rocket booster for ballistic missiles. One of the company’s top officials, Sayyed Javad Musavi, has allegedly worked in tandem with the Korea Mining Development Trading Corp. (KOMID), which the United States and UN have sanctioned for being a central player in procuring equipment for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. For example, Shahid Hemmat has illegally shipped valves, electronics, and measuring equipment to KOMID for use in ground testing of space-launch vehicles and liquid-propellant ballistic missiles. POLICY IMPLICATIONS North Korea has emerged as a critical partner in the alliance of states, militias, and political movements known as the “Axis of Resistance,” which Tehran developed to challenge U.S. power in the Middle East. Pyongyang has served as an important supplier of arms and equipment to Iran’s most important Arab ally, Syria’s Assad regime, during the country’s ongoing war. And Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have procured weapons from North Korea in their efforts to topple the internationally recognized government in Yemen, according to current and former U.S. officials. Moreover, Kim Yong-nam’s August trip appeared to have official support from Russia and China. On his way to Iran, he first flew to Vladivostok on Air Koryo, the North Korean airline that the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned in December 2016 for financially aiding the Kim regime and its ballistic missile program. He then flew on to Tehran via Russia’s state carrier, Aeroflot, passing through Chinese airspace. Going forward, the most pressing question is whether a smoking gun will emerge proving direct nuclear cooperation between Iran and North Korea. The U.S. government and the International Atomic Energy Agency say they have yet to see such conclusive evidence. But Iranian opposition groups allege that senior regime officials have visited North Korea to observe some of its six nuclear weapons tests. Chief among these officials, they add, is Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an Iranian general whom the UN has accused of working closely with Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani on secret nuclear weapons research. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials say these accusations cannot be ruled out, so all known contacts between the two regimes need to be scrutinized closely.

    "description": "(Phys.org)—Although there are many counterintuitive ideas in quantum theory, the idea that influences can travel backwards in time (from the future to the past) is generally not one of them. However, recently some physicists have been looking into this idea, called \"retrocausality,\" because it can potentially resolve some long-standing puzzles in quantum physics. In particular, if retrocausality is allowed, then the famous Bell tests can be interpreted as evidence for retrocausality and not for action-at-a-distance—a result that Einstein and others skeptical of that \"spooky\" property may have appreciated.",

    "description": "The election of a liberal Jesuit to the papacy thrilled Democrats in the United States, whose unholy alliance with the Catholic left goes back many decades. Barack Obama, one of the pope’s most prominent supporters, has long been a beneficiary of that alliance. The faculty at Jesuit Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., ranked as one of the top donors to his campaign. In a grim irony, Obama, whose presidency substantially eroded religious freedom in America, rose to power not in spite of the Catholic Church but because of it. The archdiocese of Chicago helped bankroll his radicalism in the 1980s.",

    "description": "ConservativeHQ: Senator John McCain’s most recent rant against Donald Trump, taking the side of Muslim Brotherhood connected Democrat Khizr Khan and personally defending him against Trump’s criticism of his speech to the Democratic National Convention prompts us to ask “Why does John McCain always take the side of the Muslim Brotherhood?” Khizr Khan’s ties to the Muslim Brotherhood have been documented by Walid and Robert Shoebat in a lengthy expose you can read through this link. Among the Shoebats’ more revealing findings is their review of Khizr Khan’s magnum opus on Shariah or Islamic law entitled “Juristic Classification of Islamic Law” in which he made this revealing statement: This brings up an important fact which is generally overlooked, that the invariable and basic rules of Islamic Law are only those prescribed in the Shari'ah (Quran and Sunnah) which are few and limited. All other juridical works which have been written during the more than thirteen centuries are very rich and indispensable, but they must always be subordinate to the Shari'ah and open to reconsideration by all Muslims. In other words, all other law, such as the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights are subordinate to the Shariah and if we understand the concept of “open to reconsideration by all Muslims” correctly, are invalid if they conflict with Shariah.

    "headline": "Records: NXIVM hacked billionaire's emails with Hillary Clinton, world leaders - Times Union",
    "description": "Clare W. Bronfman, an heiress of the Seagram Company business empire, allegedly implanted a \"key logger\" virus on the computer of her late father, Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., so officials with the NXIVM corporation could secretly monitor his emails, including his exchanges with world leaders and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to court records.  The accusations by Keeffe are contained in a transcript of a telephone conversation that took place last March between Keeffe and Barbara J. Bouchey, a former NXIVM executive board member who is facing computer trespassing charges in Albany that accuse her and three others of improperly accessing the corporation's website.  Keeffe said she fled NXIVM last year with the help of a State Police investigator who brought her to a domestic violence shelter, according to court records.  Last month, the Times Union reported that Keeffe, in emails attributed to her, claimed top officials in NXIVM paid a Canadian investigative firm to sift the financial records of six federal judges and U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.  According to Keeffe, NXIVM officials also used the Canadian firm to obtain financial information on Edgar Bronfman and other officials with the Jewish World Congress, which Bronfman headed from 1981 to 2007.  According to federal court records, in March 2009, the Canadian investigative firm, Canaprobe Group, sent an invoice to Clare Bronfman for $10,000 for \"banking sweep services\" of Rick A. Ross, who said he is a \"recognized expert\" in cults and who is being sued by NXIVM in U.S. District Court in New Jersey.  \"Pam Nichols and Clare flew to Canada on more than one occasion to try to, you know, vet the information, to get some of the money back, it was never done through an attorney, so they have, you know, again you have a closed circle of financiers,\" Keeffe told Bouchey, according to the transcript.  In the telephone conversation last March, Keeffe claimed Clare Bronfman's initial attempt to hack into her father's email account failed after she sent him an email that had a digital photo of a bear attached and which contained a computer-hacking virus.  \"[...] he told me that (his broker) had suggested to him that there was somebody trading against us who was extremely wealthy in the Jewish community and alluded to the fact that it might be my father,\" Bronfman testified.  In the emails and telephone conversation attributed to Keeffe, she also accused NXIVM officials of plotting to lure four women, who were former girlfriends or female associates of Raniere's, to Mexico in order to have them arrested on false charges and thrown in prison.  The women allegedly targeted included Bouchey, who was Raniere's former girlfriend and a NXIVM board member for nine years; Toni F. Foley, another former girlfriend of Raniere's and a co-defendant of Bouchey's in the computer trespassing case; and Susan Dones, a former NXIVM trainer from Washington who was sued by NXIVM and accused of violating a confidentiality agreement.  According to Keeffe, the alleged plan to lure the women to Mexico in 2012 was discussed by Raniere and Emiliano Salinas, a NXIVM leader and venture capitalist who is the son of a former Mexican president, Carlos Salinas.",

    "description": "Opinion by William Heuisler John McCain accepted millions from the Left to silence Conservatives. McCain followed orders from his multi-million-dollar-donor, George Soros, to help Liberal Democrats construct the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill that exempts News Media, but regulates Conservative, pro-life and Tea Party political speech. How has McCain-Feingold silenced Conservatives? In 2011 and 2012 our Internal Revenue Service (IRS) delayed many of our conservative groups’ campaigns for the 2012 presidential election for months and years. In fact, as you read this, some Conservative groups are still not allowed 501(c)(4) fund-raising status due to alleged McCain-Feingold-prohibited-speech. (1) (2) (4) (5) George Soros? Look him up (3) & (5). McCain’s own Alexandria, Virginia, REFORM INSTITUTE was formed to (among other things) hide funding from Soros' Left Wing OPEN SOCIETY INSTITUTE. Soros planned, incited and financially backed McCain-Feingold after expressing anger at many Republican election wins. He may have succeeded; IRS audits may have won the 2012 election for Obama, using McCain-Feingold to target Conservative groups with harassment, threats, unconstitutional, intimidating questions and long delays. Then the IRS obstructed justice for years - blamed “rogue agents” and destroyed evidence of systematic IRS voter-targeting in Chief Lois Lerner's computer. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) In May 2013, a Treasury Inspector General audit discovered how, before the 2012 election, IRS Agents targeted groups with Patriot and Tea Party in their names to enforce McCain-Feingold. Lois Lerner admitted the IRS \"inappropriately targeted\" conservatives. In February of 2014 Dave Camp, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, confirmed 100% of 501(c)(4) groups selected for IRS audit prior to the 2012 election were conservative!  (1) (2) (4) Republicans must realize our own Government (the IRS) opposes Republican Conservatives and ignores Democrats.  IRS Chief, Koskinen donated $100,000 to Democrats. The 150,000 IRS Agent Union donated to Democrats and endorsed Obama. IRS ex-Chief Lerner used many anti-GOP insults in emails and called Tea Party members \"crazies\". Our Senate Finance Committee described the illegal acts of IRS thugs targeting Republican Tea Party groups with cover-words like “partisanship”, “incompetence” and “gross mismanagement”. But the weasel-words hide ugly crimes against Democracy. McCain, Feingold, Levin and Soros have corrupted our elections by urging militant and partisan Government Agents to silence Conservative voters by using Federal police-powers dictated by McCain-Feingold. And as late as 2013, Senator McCain and Senator Levin still complained the IRS was “not reining in political advocacy groups”. (1) (2) (4) (5) Bill Heuisler (Republican, Marine, Cop, Investigator & author of 3 books on Amazon). I am amazed how easily our rights to vote and Freedom of Speech have been stolen through the treachery of John McCain and his friend, George Soros. 1) http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-irs-documents-reveal-lerner-knew-targeting-criteria-of-nonprofit-groups-might-raise-questions/ 2) http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/080615-765553-jailtime-for-irs-political-hacks.htm#ixzz3i9N3B37V 3) http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=456 4) http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/weekly-updates/more-irs-smoking-gun-emails/ 5)",

    "headline": "Secrets of NXIVM - Times Union",
    "description": "Claiming one of the world's highest IQs and holding three degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Raniere has evolved over the past two decades from the fresh-faced founder of Consumers' Buyline Inc., a buying club business investigated for being a pyramid scheme, into the 51-year-old intellectual commander of NXIVM, a Colonie-based company promising followers from Canada to Mexico it can \"help transform and, ultimately, be an expression of the noble civilization of humans.\"  At least one cult expert said Raniere directs one of the most extreme cults he has ever studied and has likened Raniere to David Koresh, who most Americans link with images of a burning cult compound packed with women and children.  Raniere \"is a compulsive gambler, a sex addict with bizarre desires and needs, and a con man that specializes in Ponzi schemes,\" one of his former girlfriends, Toni Natalie, recently declared in federal court.  Since the 1990s, Raniere has attracted the attention of attorneys general in several states and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In 1996, he admitted no guilt but signed an agreement with the New York State Attorney General's Office promising he would not operate an illegal \"chain distributor scheme\" and pay a $40,000 settlement.  [...] he has never been prosecuted by any state or federal agency, and he had only been sued once as of last month — a countersuit by a noted cult expert who claims NXIVM invaded his privacy.  Through the years, Raniere has remained a somewhat mysterious figure, but based on a yearlong investigation, including scores of interviews and a review of business records, police reports and court documents, the Times Union has uncovered troubling details about a man once considered a boy genius.  [...] this assessment comes without a response from Raniere, who did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him, including certified and overnight letters sent to him and his last known attorney.  The evolving portrait of him through the years reveals an unexpected charmer who has drawn countless people into investing in his projects, buying into his ideology and at times sliding into his bed.  A home-schooling mother recalled Raniere saying her daughter was strikingly bright, and that the woman was a \"wonderful mother and nurturer\" who had a special place in his heart and profound role to play on this planet.  Raniere has never married, but he has spent most of the last 24 years in this little area living in neighboring townhouses with Pamela Cafritz, Kristin Keeffe and Karen Unterreiner, three women who are former Consumers' Buyline employees and current NXIVM devotees.  Raniere landed on the cover of Forbes magazine in 2003 as part of a story called \"Cult of Personality.\"  [...] former followers have said, he has dropped into the background of NXIVM in an effort to avoid attracting the attention of the government, according to sworn testimony.  Ross has been qualified and accepted as an expert witness regarding cults and cultlike groups in the courts of 10 states and has been used by the federal government as a consultant.  Ross was asked to provide insight on David Koresh to the federal government during the height of the Waco situation and says Raniere shows characteristics similar to Koresh.  Like the infamous leader of the Branch Davidians, Ross said, Raniere thinks he knows a way to reorder human existence, believes he is on the cutting edge of the new wave of the future, has followers who see him as a savior and uses his position of power to gain sexual favors from women.  In the 1980s and 1990s, it's believed Raniere had sexual relationships with three underage women, according to Times Union interviews with those women and their close family members.  Ross, who had two mental health professionals review the NXIVM curriculum, said he believes followers of NXIVM undergo a \"thought reform\" or \"brainwashing\" and \"the ability of people to independently think is largely compromised.\"  When Raniere's investments in the commodities market were failing to pan out despite his mathematical formula to conquer it, he told Barbara Bouchey, one of his investors, that her emotional reaction to losing money was influencing the universal forces and affecting him negatively on a spiritual level, Bouchey recalled in an October 2009 deposition and June 2010 sworn statement filed in federal court.  Through the years, Raniere has shown an interest in hypnotism and neurolinguistic programming, a technique that identifies how people have been \"programmed\" to think and act and analyzes their words and body language in order to help them shed those beliefs.  Students are told it's essential that much of the world's money be controlled by ethical people for human existence to survive.  Joseph Szimhart, a cult information specialist from Birdsboro, Pa., who broke away from his own damaging, two-year participation in a large New Age sect, has been recognized by courts as an expert on cults.  \"Based on evidence from NXIVM-related websites alone, Raniere fits the profile of a self-centered cult leader promoting warped ideas of individual transformation,\" Szimhart said.  The child is a seedling in Raniere's \"Rainbow Cultural Garden,\" described by Raniere as \"a revolutionary child development program promoting children's cultural, linguistic, emotional, physical and problem-solving potential.\"",

    "description": "The \"weaving spiders\" motto also provides cover for a club that discriminates against women.  [...] in the Bay Area, good liberals and civil libertarians who would not dream of joining a club that refuses to admit blacks or Jews, raise their glasses in a club that discriminates against women.  A roster of 2010 members released by norcaltruth.org - the club does not release its membership list - includes a couple of Rockefellers and the ubiquitous Koch brothers.  [...] conspiracy theories about sinister deals cut amid the redwoods.  Some men kept coming back to the same camps every year to discuss intimate issues - their prostates, wives - in an atmosphere analogous to a men's group.  California courts have upheld the club's right to exclude female members but ordered it to hire female staff at the club and at the grove's food facilities.  [...] I buy Phillips' summation - that the retreat presents powerful \"men celebrating their male eliteness, which is kind of how the world works.\"  The male-only bastion's discriminatory polices hurt women trying to compete in business and politics - and everyone in politics knows it.",

He is a nephew of King Fahd of Saudia Arabia and a grandson of the Kingdom's founder, King Abdulaziz al-Saud.   The 40-year-old Prince has relished taking high-profile international investments in which he believes his capital, teaming up with superior management, can earn significant returns. The Prince, backed by a staff of Arab and Western financiers, has concentrated particularly on the international hotel, financial services and entertainment industries, spending hundreds of millions of dollars in a string of headline-grabbing announcements.",
