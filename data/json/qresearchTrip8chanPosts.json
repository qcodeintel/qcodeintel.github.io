Train drags truck body down the tracks until the body rolls off down the embankment.\n\nQuestion is, if truck tried to run crossing, why didn't occupants flee cab when getting stuck, unless train hit the truck just as it was trying to run the crossing.?\n\nHave to figure, though, if aerial surveillance sees truck and warns engineer, the truck had to have been there for a while, so why didn't occupants flee?\n\nIf the truck was there as a plant, the only sense I can make of it is that the occupants were patsies, i.e., they were told they were only going to force the train to stop, on the idea of an antifa protest.\n\nI don't think surveillance would see a truck headed towards the crossing and tell the engineer to brake, assuming the truck would stop on the tracks. However, it could be that the access road was closed and any traffic was regarded as a danger.\n\nKey is how fast does an amtrak train usually go through there, and how fast was this one going. If this train was slower, then why?\n",

As someone who spent the past 27 years working with him at EFF, I can say that nothing could be further from the truth. Barlow knew that new technology could create and empower evil as much as it could create and empower good. He made a conscious decision to focus on the latter: \"I knew it’s also true that a good way to invent the future is to predict it. So I predicted Utopia, hoping to give Liberty a running start before the laws of Moore and Metcalfe delivered up what Ed Snowden now correctly calls 'turn-key totalitarianism.'”\n\nBarlow’s lasting legacy is that he devoted his life to making the Internet into “a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth . . . a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.”\n\nIn the days and weeks to come, we will be talking and writing more about what a extraordinary role Barlow played for the Internet and the world. And as always, we will continue the work to fulfill his dream.\n\nSource: https:// www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/john-perry-barlow-internet-pioneer-1947-2018\n",

Digital signals allow for much greater distance to be covered on much less power (thus miniaturization of phones) because of the nature of square (digital) waves.  Much more effective at filtering noise and interference.  \n\nThis inherently means that the phones of today are going to be square wave signals and very low power.  If that alone were enough, Q would not exist.  They would simply shut him (them) and/or us down.  So they may act as a trigger but are not enough by themselves to completely program a human.  And Parkland would suggest that you really need somebody who is largely predisposed toward moving in the desired direction to begin with.  You can't just flip a switch and a born pacifist suddenly becomes Rambo.  Talk to me, Johnny!\n",

Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 to carry out MKULTRA experiments there. In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His \"driving\" experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanently from his actions.[8] His treatments resulted in victims' incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents.[9][10]\n\nWhen lawsuits commenced in 1986, the Canadian government denied having any knowledge that Cameron was being sponsored by the CIA.[11]\n\nhttp:// www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/40-years-of-the-fifth-estate/mk-ultra\n\nhttp:// www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadian-government-gag-order-mk-ultra-1.4448933\n\nhttp:// www.nytimes.com/1992/11/19/world/canada-will-pay-50-s-test-victims.html\n\nhttp:// coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/issue43/articles/1957_1961_canada.htm\n\nhttps:// www.mcgilldaily.com/2012/09/mk-ultraviolence/\n",

Digital signals allow for much greater distance to be covered on much less power (thus miniaturization of phones) because of the nature of square (digital) waves.  Much more effective at filtering noise and interference.  \n\nThis inherently means that the phones of today are going to be square wave signals and very low power.  If that alone were enough, Q would not exist.  They would simply shut him (them) and/or us down.  So they may act as a trigger but are not enough by themselves to completely program a human.  And Parkland would suggest that you really need somebody who is largely predisposed toward moving in the desired direction to begin with.  You can't just flip a switch and a born pacifist suddenly becomes Rambo.  Talk to me, Johnny!\n",

It actually describes clowns planning to use school shootings as a way to disarm the citizenry. \n\nThis looks legit to me, astonishing as the quotes are. What say you all? \n\nBehold a Pale Horse — Milton William (Bill) Cooper, 1991\nhttp://  a.co/0IZY9ra\n\n“Bill Cooper, former United States Naval Intelligence Briefing Team member, reveals information that remains hidden from the public eye. This information has been kept in topsecret government files since the 1940s. His audiences hear the truth unfold as he writes about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the war on drugs, the secret government, and UFOs. Bill is a lucid, rational, and powerful speaker whose intent is to inform and to empower his audience. Standing room only is normal. His presentation and information transcend partisan affiliations as he clearly addresses issues in a way that has a striking impact on listeners of all backgrounds and interests. He has spoken to many groups throughout the United States and has appeared regularly on many radio talk shows and on television. In 1988 Bill decided to \"talk\" due to events then taking place worldwide, events that he had seen plans for back in the early 1970s. Bill correctly predicted the lowering of the Iron Curtain, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the invasion of Panama. All Bill's predictions were on record well before the events occurred. Bill is not a psychic. His information comes from top secret documents that he read while with the Intelligence Briefing Team and from over seventeen years of research.”\n",
